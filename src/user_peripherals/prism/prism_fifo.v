// Small standard-cell byte FIFO for a PRISM shard (changes.md item 9).
//
// One FIFO per shard, direction chosen by CFG0 fifo_dir in prism_periph.v:
//   RX: the FSM pushes comm with OUT_FIFO_WR_RD, the host pops by reading
//       FIFO_DATA
//   TX: the host pushes by writing FIFO_DATA, the FSM pops into comm with
//       OUT_FIFO_WR_RD
// A push on a full FIFO and a pop on an empty one are ignored.  The head is
// available combinationally; count / empty / full / programmable
// almost-empty and almost-full levels feed the PRISM inputs and the status
// register.  Contents survive PRISM enable / disable (the host may fill a TX
// FIFO before starting the FSM); only reset and flush clear it.  The storage
// is latch rows (see below), written two clocks after the push; `count`
// counts the byte on that clock, so a reader that waits for the count always
// finds it.
//
// Constant-table mode (tab_en, CONST_TAB in prism_periph.v): the head is
// row tab_idx instead of the read pointer's row, so the 16 rows serve as
// addressable constants for OUT_COMM_LOAD; pushes and flushes still work
// (that is how the host loads the table).

    // be at least three clocks apart.  Consecutive pushes alternate banks, so
