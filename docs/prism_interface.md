# PRISM peripheral, Phase 0: interface budget, config bits, memory map

Working document for the changes listed in `changes.md`.  Everything here is
a proposal to be edited; the numbers that are fixed by hardware already in
place are marked as such.

Fixed by the current core / cfg (`chromas/tinyqv32.cfg`): 32 inputs and 21
outputs per shard, 6 input muxes of 5 bits, two LUT3 decision trees, two
LUT2 conditional outputs, 32 states (16 per shard when fractured), 128-bit
STEW in the CFGMEM macros, 512-byte register region at 0x8000200.

## 1. Outputs per shard (21)

From `changes.md` item 12, with the spares filled in as suggestions.

| bit | name | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | pin_out[0] | muxable to uo_out[7:1] |
| 1 | pin_out[1] | muxable to uo_out[7:1] |
| 2 | pin_out[2] | muxable to uo_out[7:1] |
| 3 | pin_out[3] | muxable to uo_out[7:1] |
| 4 | OUT_LATCH | re-capture the in_prev flops selected by the firing tree (edge-detect ack); also usable in the default word for free-running capture |
| 5 | OUT_FIFO_WR_RD | FIFO push of comm (RX mode) / pop into comm (TX mode), per CFG0 fifo_dir (Phase 4) |
| 6 | OUT_COUNT1_INC_DEC | count1 step, direction from config (count up / down) |
| 7 | OUT_COUNT1_CLEAR_LOAD | clear, or load from preload, per config |
| 8 | OUT_SHIFT | shift the 24/32-bit or the 8-bit shifter (config selects which) |
| 9 | OUT_COUNT2_INC | |
| 10 | OUT_COUNT2_DEC | |
| 11 | OUT_COUNT2_CLEAR | |
| 12 | OUT_CRC_CLEAR | reset CRC to init value (counter mode: preset the count, 0 or all ones) |
| 13 | OUT_CRC_UPDATE | feed the shifter's current bit (or byte) into the CRC (counter mode: count + 1) |
| 14 | OUT_HOST_INTERRUPT | set the shard's sticky interrupt flag once per assertion (edge-detected in the peripheral, not re-armed every clock the state persists); two interrupt lines to the host, one per shard |
| 15 | OUT_SEMA_CLEAR / OUT_FIFO_PUSH_POP | fractured: clear the semaphore the other shard set for us (setting it towards the other shard rides on OUT_SEMA_SET).  Unfractured (shard 0): bit 5 strobes FIFO A (0) or FIFO B (1), i.e. push / pop with A = RX, B = TX; see 4b |
| 16 | OUT_COMM_LOAD | load comm from preload[7:0], or from constant K[{out20, out18}] with CFG0[30] (4h) |
| 17 | OUT_LOAD_CRC | load the selected shifter from the CRC: the wide shifter takes all 32 bits, comm takes one byte per load in wire order and the CRC advances to the next byte (4h); counter mode: count - 1, no shifter load |
| 18 | OUT_K_SEL0 | constant select bit 0 for OUT_COMM_LOAD when CFG0[30] is set (4h) |
| 19 | OUT_SEMA_SET / OUT_FLAG2 | fractured: set the sticky semaphore seen by the other shard.  Also the value OUT_LATCH stores in flag2 with CFG0[29] (4h) |
| 20 | OUT_K_SEL1 | constant select bit 1 (4h) |

Chroma-visible change vs today: OUT_SHIFT moves from 6 to 8 and the count
controls are renumbered; the four test chromas and `chromas/*.v` need their
`out_data[]` assignments updated when this lands (mechanical).

## 2. Inputs per shard (32)

Bits 0-15 keep today's meaning so the existing chromas stay valid; new
features take 16 and up.

| bit | name | source |
|---|---|---|
| 0-6 | pin_in[6:0] | ui_in[6:0] via the per-shard raw / 1-flop / 2-flop select (item 13) |
| 7 | shift_data | serial-out bit of the selected shifter |
| 8-9 | host_in[1:0] | host handshake bits |
| 10 | count1_term | count1 == 0 counting down; count1 == preload (or natural roll-over) counting up (item 3) |
| 11 | count2_cmp | count2 >= count2_compare |
| 12-13 | latched_in[1:0] | {shift_data, cond_out[0]} captured by OUT_LATCH (the SPI slave and encoder chromas rely on it), or the latched outputs with CFG0[7] |
| 14 | shift_term | shift count reached the configured length (with the "load sets count to 1" mode, items 4/5) |
| 15 | count2_eq_comm | count2 == comm_data |
| 16-19 | slots, default in_prev[3:0] | input slots (4h): CFG2 picks in_prev[k], a comm bit, comm == K3 or flag2; default = the edge-capture flops (sources CFG1[15:0], see 4g) |
| 20 | fifo flag slot E | own FIFO: empty by default; CFG1[25:24] selects almost-empty / full / almost-full |
| 21 | fifo flag slot F | own FIFO: full by default; CFG1[27:26] selects almost-full / empty / almost-empty |
| 22 | crc_ok | CRC residue equals the expected / magic value; counter mode (CFG3[10]): count >= CRC_EXPECTED, unsigned |
| 23 | count1_wrap | count1 rolled over (count-up natural mode) |
| 24 | sema_in | sticky semaphore set by the other shard's OUT_SEMA_SET, cleared by this shard's OUT_SEMA_CLEAR (same-cycle winner = CFG0[24]); implemented Phase 2 |
| 25 | other_shard_halt | the other shard is halted (debugger); implemented Phase 2 |
| 26-27 | FIFO B flag slots E / F | shard 0 unfractured: two of shard 1's FIFO flags, selects CFG1[29:28] / [31:30]; 0 otherwise |
| 28-31 | slots, default 0 | input slots (4h): CFG2[31:16], same menu |

Note on the trees: tree 0 reads muxes 0-2, tree 1 reads 3-5, cond 0 reads
muxes 1 and 4, cond 1 reads 3 and 5 (RTL wiring, matched by the cfg).

## 3. Per-shard configuration bits (non-state-specific)

Held in the shard's CFG0 / CFG1 registers (section 4).  Today's 14 control
bits are kept where they are; `fifo_24` (bit 11) is freed by item 2.

CFG0 (existing layout, extended):

| bits | name | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1:0 | shift_in_sel | which ui_in feeds the shifter |
| 2 | mshift_en | multi-bit comm shift: {out20, out18} + 1 bits per OUT_SHIFT from pins shift_in_sel .. + 3, section 4r (bits 5:3 spare) |
| 5:4 | cond_out_sel | which uo_out carries cond_out[0] |
| 6 | load4 | 8-bit comm load from preload (renamed in item 2 cleanup) |
| 7 | latch_in_out | in[13:12] = latched outputs instead of latched inputs |
| 8 | shift_en | |
| 9 | shift_dir | 0 = MSB first, 1 = LSB first |
| 10 | shift_wide | 0 = 8-bit comm shifter, 1 = 24/32-bit shifter (was shift_24_en) |
| 11 | count_width | 0 = 24-bit, 1 = 32-bit (item 3; was fifo_24) |
| 12 | count2_dec_en | |
| 13 | latch_en | OUT_LATCH enable (was latch3) |
| 24 | sema_set_wins | semaphore set beats clear in the same cycle (else clear wins) |
| 14 | count_up | count1 counts up (item 3) |
| 15 | wrap_at_preload | count-up roll-over at preload instead of natural (item 3) |
| 16 | shift_load_one | 24/32-bit shift load sets shift count to 1 (item 4) |
| 17 | comm_load_one | 8-bit comm load sets its count to 1 (item 5) |
| 19:18 | in_sync_sel | 0 = 2 flops (today), 1 = 1 flop, 2 = raw (item 13) |
| 21:20 | crc_mode | 0 = off, 1 = CRC8, 2 = CRC16, 3 = CRC32 (item 8) |
| 22 | crc_reflect | bit order into the CRC |
| 23 | fifo_dir | OUT_FIFO_WR_RD pushes (TX) or pops (RX) |
| 25 | crc_init_ones | |
| 26 | crc_xor_out | |
| 27 | crc_src | 0 = shifter input bit, 1 = shifter output bit |
| 28 | shift_in_cond | the shifter shifts in cond_out[0] instead of a pin: an FSM-decoded bit (NRZI, Manchester) or a constant (4h) |
| 29 | flag_latch | OUT_LATCH stores {cond_out[1], cond_out[0]} in latched_in and output 19 in flag2: three FSM-settable flags (4h) |
| 30 | comm_load_k | OUT_COMM_LOAD takes constant K[{out20, out18}] from CONST instead of preload[7:0] (4h) |
| 31 | fifo_sram | this shard's FIFO is the 8 KB SRAM FIFO (4i); one per PRISM, shard 0 wins if both ask |

CFG1 (as built):

| bits | name | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 3:0 | in_prev0_src | PRISM input number the flop follows: 0-6 = ui_in pin (after the sync select), 8 = host_in[0], 9 = host_in[1]; anything else reads 0 |
| 7:4 | in_prev1_src | |
| 11:8 | in_prev2_src | |
| 15:12 | in_prev3_src | |
| 19:16 | fifo_ae_level | almost-empty when count <= level |
| 23:20 | fifo_af_level | almost-full when count >= 16 - level |
| 25:24 | fifo_flag20 | input 20 (empty side): bit 0 = almost-, bit 1 = other side |
| 27:26 | fifo_flag21 | input 21 (full side): bit 0 = almost-, bit 1 = other side |
| 29:28 | fifo_b_flag26 | input 26, FIFO B (shard 0 unfractured), empty side |
| 31:30 | fifo_b_flag27 | input 27, FIFO B, full side |

The flag slots let any two of a FIFO's four flags reach the two inputs
(a pusher wants full / almost-full, a popper empty / almost-empty) while
the reset value keeps the original meaning, empty on 20 and full on 21.

CFG2 (+0x34, per shard, 4h): eight 4-bit input slot selects, [3:0] ..
[15:12] for inputs 16-19 and [19:16] .. [31:28] for inputs 28-31.  Codes:
0 = the slot's default (in_prev[k] for 16-19, 0 for 28-31), 1-4 =
in_prev[0..3], 5-12 = comm[0..7], 13 = comm == K3, 14 = flag2.  The comm
bits let the decision trees decode a received byte (a USB PID, a
command) without a match register per value.

CONST (+0x38, per shard, 4h): four constants K0 [7:0] .. K3 [31:24].
With CFG0[30] OUT_COMM_LOAD loads comm from K[{out20, out18}] (sync
words, handshake codes, addresses); K3 is also the comm match value.

Common (not per shard): enable, fractured, interrupt enables/status, output
masks for fractured mode, debug controls (already in the core).

## 4. Memory map (512-byte region at 0x8000200), item 10

All registers word aligned at +4 offsets.  Sub-word reads return the
addressed byte lane in the low bits of the read data (TinyQV convention,
same as the CFGMEM control byte), so packed registers can be read and
written one byte at a time.

Common block 0x000-0x0FF:

| offset | register |
|---|---|
| 0x00 | CTRL: [30] enable, [31] shard 0 interrupt (RO), [29] shard 1 interrupt (RO); byte 0x03 write with bit 7 = shard 0 interrupt clear (kept: a single byte store is what chromas like PCM/ADPCM rely on), byte 0x07 = shard 1 interrupt clear.  Shard interrupts are TinyQV user interrupts 8 and 9 |
| 0x04 | DBG_CTRL0 (shard 0, exists) |
| 0x08 | DBG_CTRL1 (shard 1, exists) |
| 0x0C | STATUS (curr/next SI, halt, break, per shard; exists) |
| 0x10-0x1C | STEW of shard 0's current state (exists) |
| 0x20 | ID word |
| 0x24 | INT_STATUS (read): [1:0] shard interrupts, [3:2] semaphore as seen by shard 0 / shard 1 |
| 0x30 | DEBUG_DOUT (exists) |
| 0x34 | DECISION (exists) |
| 0x38 | OUT_DATA (exists) |
| 0x3C | IN_DATA (exists) |
| 0x40 | FRAC_CFG (exists) |
| 0x44-0x50 | fracture output / cond masks (exist; could move into the shard windows) |
| 0x60-0xFC | spare |

Shard windows, identical layout, shard 0 at 0x100, shard 1 at 0x180
(Phase 2 implemented +0x00..+0x18 for both shards in `prism_periph.v`, each
with its own `prism_datapath`; the rest is reserved for later phases).
Unfractured, shard 0 is the whole machine and shard 1's datapath idles
(its registers stay accessible).  Fractured, each shard's own output vector
drives its own datapath, so OUT_SHIFT from shard 1 shifts shard 1's
registers only:

| offset | register |
|---|---|
| +0x00 | CFG0: datapath configuration (chroma `ctrl_reg`, bit map in section 3) |
| +0x04 | PINMUX: uo_out[7:1] source selects (chroma `pinmux_reg`, 3 bits per pin: 0-3 this shard's pin_out[n], 4/5 its cond_out[n], 6 its shift_data, 7 = this shard does not drive the pin).  A pin claimed by shard 0 goes to shard 0, otherwise to shard 1; a pin freezes while its owning shard is halted |
| +0x08 | PRELOAD (32-bit) |
| +0x0C | COUNT1 (24/32-bit; read = count, write = load) |
| +0x10 | COUNTS packed: byte 0 COUNT2, byte 1 COMPARE, byte 2 COMM, byte 3 {comm_count[2:0], shift_count[4:0]} (RO); word or byte writes load the first three |
| +0x14 | HOST_IN[1:0]; byte +0x15 write = toggle host_in[0] and clear the interrupt |
| +0x18 | FLAGS (RO): count1_term, count1_wrap, count2_cmp, count2_eq_comm, shift_term, shift_data, latched_in[1:0] |
| +0x1C | CFG1: `in_prev` pin selects, FIFO thresholds (later; the input sync mode landed in CFG0[19:18]) |
| +0x20 | FIFO data (byte lane 0) |
| +0x24 | FIFO status: count[21:8], word bytes[7:6], push busy[5], word full[4], almost_full[3], almost_empty[2], full[1], empty[0]; write = flush (the 32-bit word registers too) |
| +0x28 | CRC ctrl: init value select, poly select |
| +0x2C | CRC value (read; write = preset); counter mode: the count |
| +0x30 | CRC expected; counter mode: the compare value |
| +0x34 | CFG2: input slot selects for inputs 16-19 and 28-31 (4 bits each), section 4h |
| +0x38 | CONST: K0..K3 (K3 also the comm match value), section 4h |
| +0x3C | CFG3: Manchester bit recoverer ([2:0] pin, [3] enable, [7:4] clocks per half bit, [8] shifter input = recovered bit, [9] double-edge sampling: [7:4] in half clocks), section 4k; edge-clocked sampler ([16] enable, [21:17] clock input, [23:22] 0 rising / 1 falling / 2 either, actions on the edge [24] shift, [25] count2 + 1, [26] in_prev capture, [27] count1 clear / load, [28] flag2 swaps rising and falling), section 4p; [10] counter mode: the CRC register is a 32-bit up / down counter with compare, section 4b; [11] 32-bit FIFO access through FIFO32 (+0x54), section 4b |
| +0x40 | PRELOAD2: timer 2, [23:0] period (input 28 ticks every PRELOAD2 + 1 clocks, 0 = off), [24] restart the count on entry into state [29:25] (retriggerable timeout), [30] one-shot (with [24]: one tick per entry), section 4l |
| +0x44 | TRACE_CFG (write-only, 21 bits): [0] enable (one shard traces at a time, shard 0 wins), [1] both SRAMs as one buffer, [6] into the other shard's SRAM (this shard's SRAM FIFO keeps running), [3:2] trigger (0 now, 1 in state [12:8], 2 that state taking a jump, 3 an edge on PRISM input [20:16]; [5:4] 0 rising, 1 falling, 2 either), section 4m |
| +0x50 | COMM_PINS: multi-bit shift lanes, section 4r: [2:0] window base b (comm[b+3:b], b = 0-4), [2k+5:2k+4] the window lane uo_out[k+1] shows when its pinmux code is 6 and CFG0[2] is set |
| +0x4C | CONST_TAB: the 16x8 latch FIFO as addressable constants, section 4n: [0] enable (OUT_COMM_LOAD loads the row at the 4-bit index; {OUT_K_SEL1, OUT_K_SEL0} = how the index moves on each load: 0 clear, 1 + 1, 2 + add_to_idx [10:8], 3 = idx_load [7:4], or + idx_load with [1]), [2] post (the row before the move; default after), [19:16] the index (a write sets it, reads back live) |
| +0x48 | TRACE_CTRL: write [0] arm (flushes the SRAM FIFO), [1] stop; read [0] armed, [1] running, [2] done, [3] big, [4] active.  Entry (16 bits) = [4:0] SI, [10:5] LUT mux inputs, [11] tree 0 matched, [12] tree 1 taken, [13] executing; the traced SRAM's FIFO then serves the entries as bytes through +0x20 of the window that reads that SRAM (count = FIFO bytes / 2) |
| +0x54 | FIFO32: 32-bit FIFO access with CFG3[11], section 4b: TX a word write pushes its four bytes low byte first; RX a read takes the assembled word |
| +0x58-0x7C | spare |

The SDK (`prism.h`, item 11) then needs only a base per shard and the
common block; the per-config remap is the base addresses plus a feature
mask.

## 4a. Debugger: LUT-conditional breakpoints (item 7, Phase 3)

Each shard's debug control word (0x04 shard 0, 0x08 shard 1) gained a
2-bit condition per breakpoint:

| bits | field | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | halt_req | level: halt (rising edge) and hold |
| 1 | step | rising edge: execute one transition |
| 2, 3 | bp_en0, bp_en1 | breakpoint enables |
| 8:4, 13:9 | bp_si0, bp_si1 | breakpoint state index |
| 15:14, 17:16 | bp_cond0, bp_cond1 | 0 = on entry (as before), 1 = in the state when tree 0 ("if") matches, 2 = when tree 1 ("else if" / "else") is taken (matches while tree 0 does not; a plain `else` compiles to an always-true tree 1), 3 = when either is taken, i.e. the state exits |
| 18 | new_si | write-only: load the SI from bits 23:19 |

Read back = {debug_si[22:18], control[17:0]}.  Status (0x0C) is unchanged.

Semantics of a conditional break: in the cycle the selected decision tree
first matches while the FSM sits in `bp_si`, the core forces `next_si =
curr_si`, holds the loop bookkeeping, and raises the shard's halt line
combinationally.  The peripheral gates every datapath action, pin latch,
semaphore and interrupt edge with that line, so the transition's outputs
(counter clears, shifts, loads) do not happen: the value that satisfied
the condition is still there to read.  A single step then performs the
transition with its outputs and halts in the target state.  Keep
`halt_req` set while stepping: without it (or an active breakpoint) the
FSM resumes after a step that lands on a non-breakpoint state.  Release
from any breakpoint halt: clear the enable, pulse `halt_req`.

The halt line is now combinational for that one cycle, which also removed
the extra registered `halt_r` term from the datapath enable: a single step
now applies the stepped state's datapath outputs (previously the step
cycle was gated off, so stepping through a counting state never counted).

## 4b. FIFO and CRC per shard (items 8, 9, Phase 4)

As built in `prism_fifo.v` / `prism_crc.v`, one of each per shard:

FIFO: 64 x 8 bits (latch rows, `prism_fifo.v`; 16 on the CMOS5L tile).  Direction is CFG0[23] `fifo_dir`:
RX (0) the FSM pushes `comm` with OUT_FIFO_WR_RD and the host pops by
reading +0x20; TX (1) the host pushes by writing +0x20 and OUT_FIFO_WR_RD
pops the head into `comm` (a load: comm_count follows `comm_load_one`).
Push on full and pop on empty are ignored.  +0x24 reads
{count[21:8], almost_full[3], almost_empty[2], full[1], empty[0]}; any
write flushes.  CFG1[19:16] / [23:20] are the almost-empty and
almost-full levels in 4-byte units: almost-empty when count <= 4 x level,
almost-full when count >= 64 - 4 x level (the SRAM FIFO's are in 64-byte
units).  Inputs 20 empty, 21 full,
26 almost_full, 27 almost_empty.  Contents survive PRISM disable, so a TX
FIFO can be filled before the FSM starts.

32-bit access (CFG3[11], `FIFO32` at +0x54; sg13g2 tiles): the host moves
words instead of bytes, one instruction per four bytes.  In TX mode a
word written to FIFO32 is pushed a byte at a time, low byte first, one
every fourth clock; FIFO_STATUS[5] is set while that runs, a push waits
on a full FIFO, and a word written while busy is dropped, so poll the bit
before a write when the FIFO may be full (straight-line code never sees
it busy: four pushes take 13 clocks, TinyQV's instructions 16).  In RX
mode a pop machine takes four bytes out of the FIFO as soon as it holds
that many, low byte first, into a word register; FIFO_STATUS[4] and the
shard's interrupt say the word is complete, and a read of FIFO32 takes
it (a read of an incomplete word returns it and takes nothing).  A byte
read of +0x20 while the word register holds anything comes from its low
byte, the rest shift down and the machine refills the top from the FIFO,
so the byte order is the same however the host mixes word and byte
reads; with the mode off the register still drains first.  Short
messages leave their stragglers in the FIFO where FIFO_STATUS shows them
(count) or, after byte reads, in the word register (FIFO_STATUS[7:6],
the count of bytes held when [4] is clear): the host times out and reads
them with byte reads.  A flush empties both machines.  `test_fifo32`
runs it on the fifo_loop chroma, flop and SRAM FIFOs.

CRC: 32-bit bit-serial LFSR, programmable polynomial (+0x28), width from
CFG0[21:20] `crc_mode` (8 / 16 / 32), CFG0[22] `crc_reflect` (shift right,
reflected polynomial; width independent so USB CRC5 = poly 0x14 also
works), CFG0[25] `crc_init_ones` (OUT_CRC_CLEAR presets all ones or zero),
CFG0[27] `crc_src` (0 = the shifter's input bit, 1 = its output bit; take
it in the same cycle as OUT_SHIFT), CFG0[26] `crc_xor_out` (complement
when loaded into a shifter).  +0x2C reads the value, a write presets it;
+0x30 is the expected value; input 22 `crc_ok` = value == expected over the
width.  New output 17 OUT_LOAD_CRC loads the selected shifter (comm or
count1, per `shift_wide`) from the CRC so the checksum can be sent; through
comm each load takes the next byte in wire order (low byte first for
reflected CRCs, high byte first otherwise) and advances the CRC register,
so CRC16 / CRC32 go out in 2 / 4 loads (4h).

Counter mode (CFG3[10], `PRISM_CNT_CMP` / the `CNT_CMP` parameter builds
it; not in the CMOS5L tile): a chroma that does not use the CRC gets a
32-bit up / down counter with a 32-bit compare out of the same register
and the same three strobes.  With `crc_mode` 0 and CFG3[10] set,
OUT_CRC_CLEAR presets the register (0, or all ones with `crc_init_ones`),
OUT_CRC_UPDATE adds 1 and OUT_LOAD_CRC subtracts 1 (both in one cycle:
no change; OUT_LOAD_CRC no longer loads a shifter), and `crc_ok` (input
22, FLAGS[10]) becomes the unsigned compare count >= CRC_EXPECTED (+0x30).
The host reads and presets the count at +0x2C as before.  The cost is one
32-bit adder and one 32-bit comparator per shard: the counter reuses the
CRC's 32 flops, its host access and its strobes.  `chroma_counter` /
`test_counter` exercise it: one step per pin transition, up or down by
host_in[1], preset on a host_in[0] toggle, the compare on uo_out[1].

Two FIFOs for shard 0 (unfractured, 2026-09-13): shard 1's FIFO and its
OUT_SEMA_CLEAR output are idle while unfractured, so shard 0 owns both
FIFOs: A = its own, B = shard 1's, which the host still configures
(direction CFG0[23], levels CFG1) and serves (+0x20 / +0x24) through the
shard 1 window at 0x180.  OUT_FIFO_WR_RD strobes A when output 15, now
OUT_FIFO_PUSH_POP, is 0 and B when it is 1, each per its own direction
(push comm into an RX FIFO, pop a TX FIFO into comm).  With the usual
arrangement, A = RX and B = TX, bit 15 reads as push (0) / pop (1), and a
single-FIFO chroma (bit 15 never set) behaves exactly as before whatever
the host does with B.  A pop loads comm from the selected FIFO's head.
Shard 0 inputs 26 and 27 are two of FIFO B's flags, chosen by CFG1[31:28]
the same way inputs 20 and 21 choose the own FIFO's (section 3).
Fractured, everything is per shard as before and bit 15 is the semaphore
clear again.  `chroma_fifo_loop` (unit test) moves bytes from B (TX) to A
(RX) and counts them in count2.

Chromas: `chroma_spislave` pushes received bytes into the RX FIFO and runs
a CRC8 over the received bits; `chroma_uart_tx` is an 8N1 transmitter fed
from the TX FIFO that appends the CRC8 on request.

## 4c. Host software (item 11, Phase 5)

The tinyQV-sdk driver (`prism.h` / `prism.c`) covers this design with
`-DPRISM_CONFIG=PRISM_CONFIG_JANESTREET` (`prism_cfg_janestreet.h` holds the
register map above; `tinyQV-js.a` or `prism_js.o`).  The sky25a API is kept:
per-shard calls act on `prism_set_shard()`, `prism_set_ctrl()` writes the
shard's CFG0 plus the common enable, `prism_load_chroma_ex()` adds the pin
mux and `prism_load_shards()` fractures with two chromas.  `test/programs/
sdk_check` runs that driver on the RTL (`make sdk_check` in `test/`).

## 4d. Floorplan and timing (item 1, Phase 6)

Plan of record (2026-09-13): the eight macros sit along the top of the
tile as one 2x2 block per bank.  Bank A (lo macros): lo2/lo3 (`CFGMEM_IHP16`,
control pins west, facing the left margin) at x = 101.44 um and lo0/lo1
(`CFGMEM_IHP_LEFT16`, control pins east, facing the inter-bank channel) at
451.44 um.  Bank B (hi macros): hi2/hi3 (pins west, facing the channel) at
951.44 um and hi0/hi1 (pins east, facing the right margin) at 1301.44 um.
The top row is upright (`N`, data pins down) at y = 619.92 um (row 163) and
the second row flipped (`FS`, data pins up) at y = 510.30 um (row 134), so
both rows' 70 data pins face the 6-row channel between them and the whole
lower ~60% of the tile (rows 0-133) stays free for future macros (an SRAM
is planned).  The programming chain of each bank stays inside its block
(section 4f).  x positions are 1.44 + 50k um so the macro stripes land on
tile PDN stripes; the stripe step accepts R0 and MX since a vertical flip
keeps the pin columns.  The earlier two-column layout (x = 751.44 /
1351.44 um, four macros per column facing two 44-row cell areas) is kept
for comparison in the table below.  The stripe-extension step is now a LibreLane plugin
(`librelane_plugin_prism_pdn.py`) inserted through `meta.substituting_steps`
in `src/config.json`, so the stock Tiny Tapeout harden connects the macro
power too (`make harden-tt` runs exactly that).

Timing after Phases 1-4 roughly doubled the cell count (13.7k -> 26.9k,
utilization 34% -> 46%).  Decisions taken to close the typical corner,
which is the one the flow treats as fatal:

- `ui_in` setup paths are false paths (hold still checked): in raw mode
  the pins feed the decision trees combinationally by choice, and the TT
  input model leaves only 35% of the period for that.
- `cfg_fractured` gets a 2-cycle multicycle path: it only changes while
  the PRISM is disabled, and it was the head of the worst slow-corner path
  (bank-select mux -> CFGMEM read -> decision -> state).
- The peripherals' reset is re-registered on the rising edge
  (`rst_peri_n` in project.v): the ~1500 PRISM flops behind it gave the
  negedge `rst_reg_n` tree only a half cycle, the tightest internal path.
- `MAX_TRANSITION_CONSTRAINT` 0.75 ns, `MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT` 8 and
  `PNR_CORNERS` = typ + slow so the resizer repairs the slow corner too
  (the fatal check stays on the PDK's `TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS`).
- The CFGMEM programming chain inputs (`Di0`) are false paths, and the
  loader's host/PRISM address select, host row address and bank bypass
  bits get 2-cycle multicycle paths: all of them only change while the
  PRISM is disabled, and each headed a worst path (through a macro read
  and the decision trees) in some floorplan.

Floorplan experiments (all with the exceptions above, physical signoff
clean in every case; "PRISM path" = state register -> macro read ->
decision -> datapath register at typ / slow):

| floorplan                       | typ WNS | PRISM path      | GRT overflow | DRT iters |
|---------------------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| two columns (previous)          | +1.18   | +1.60 / -5.63   | 2296         | 12        |
| 1x4 rows stacked at the top     | +0.97   | +1.21 / -6.32   | 2061         | 10        |
| 2x2 block per bank (POR)        | +0.91   | +1.07 / -6.41   | 2149         | 13        |

The stacked and 2x2 layouts leave the lower ~60% of the tile free for
future macros; the two-column layout keeps each bank's four words closest
to the logic between the columns, which is where its PRISM-path margin
comes from.  Typ WNS is the CPU's QSPI clock output path in the stacked
and 2x2 runs.  The 2x2 layout was chosen for the open area.

### 4d.1 Floorplan with the SRAM (2026-09-14)

Adding the 1024x32 SRAM (section 4i) broke every floorplan that had
routed before, and the reasons turned out to be structural rather than a
matter of density:

- **A CFGMEM column is a routing wall.**  Global-routing overflow maps
  (`global_route -congestion_report_file` on the pre-route ODB, binned
  50 um) of the reference two-column run and of every SRAM layout put all
  the overflow over the LEFT16 column and its cell strips, none in the
  open half of the tile.  The macro blocks Metal2 completely and its Metal3
  route-through is chopped into short pieces, so east-west crossings only
  fit in the 166 um strips between the four macros.  Any logic on the far
  side of a column from the channel (TinyQV, the SRAM wrapper) pays for
  that; spreading the placement (target density 40) made it worse.
- **The SRAM is a wall on every layer.**  Its LEF obstructs Metal1-3 fully
  and Metal4 everywhere except its own 2.81 um power columns (0.26 um
  margin), so nothing crosses it, and a stripe over it must sit inside a
  column of the same polarity.  The columns alternate VDD/VSS every 5.62 um
  (11.24 um per polarity) in two 16-column halves, the right one 0.67 um
  off the left one's grid, around a ~57 um irregular centre band.  Its 190
  signal pins are Metal2 on one long face (`FS` puts them on top).
- **The first SRAM FIFO wrapper was the area problem**, not the SRAM:
  1380 cells / 20k um2 (section 4i); the word-assembly rewrite is 9.7k.

Column layouts with the SRAM flush left (wrapper above it, pins on top):

| layout (LEFT16 column x, SRAM x)             | GRT overflow | DRT                          |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| 751 / 3.36, byte-queue wrapper               | 4354         | 33k 22k 19k 8.8k 6.4k (stopped) |
| 751 / 3.36, word wrapper                     | 8179         | not run                      |
| 451 / 3.36 (31 um corridor to the SRAM)      | 2237         | plateau ~105: all shorts inside the SRAM, the corridor overflowed and the router forced wires through the macro |
| 501 / 3.36 (81 um corridor)                  | 1803         | 24354 11729 10634 772 39 20 11 11 0 |

The 501 layout routes; its typ setup slack is +0.79 ns.  It is kept as
the fallback (`src/config_left501.json`).

**Band layout on the SRAM's grid (user's plan).**  To put the 2x2 band
back at the top with the SRAM underneath, the tile stripes have to run
through the SRAM on its columns and through the CFGMEM macros on their
rails at the same x.  Both macro types were regenerated in DFFRAM with
`PDN_VPITCH` 44.96 (= 4 x 11.24) and `PDN_VSPACING` 3.52 (VGND 5.62 um
from VPWR), rails at 11.44 / 17.06 + 44.96k from the macro origin, one
minute per macro, DRC/LVS clean.  The tile uses the same pitch and
spacing with `FP_PDN_VOFFSET` 6.15, so the first VPWR stripe is at 9.03 um
= the SRAM at x 3.36 plus its first VDD column; CFGMEM macros then go at
x = -2.41 + 44.96k and the SRAM at 3.36 + 11.24i.  With that, ten stripe
pairs cross the SRAM: four exact, five nudged 0.67-0.83 um (still
overlapping the rail above by 1.3-1.4 um of its 2.1), two redrawn on the
nearest centre-band column (~10 um; the rail above them is fed through
the macro's Metal1 row rails instead).  The stripe step (`odb_stripes.py`)
collects SRAM columns and all rails first, keeps redrawn stripes 0.24
um clear of opposite-polarity rails, treats any stripe overlapping the
SRAM as crossing it, and skips a rail stripe that would cross the SRAM
off-column.

The SRAM has three regions with separate internal meshes: two bit-cell
arrays (`VDDARRAY!`/`VSS!` columns, with the periphery's `VDD!` columns
below them on the same x) and, between them, a ~40 um band of the
macro's own standard cells (four full-height `VDD!` columns and the
`VSS!` columns beside them).  Moving every tile stripe onto its nearest
column left the band with two VPWR but one VGND, and the right array's
edge with a VGND but no VPWR (the partner of each had landed in the
other region).  The step therefore allocates both nets at once per
macro: nearest free column first, then a stripe whose partner sits in
another region gets a partner on the adjacent column of its own region,
and the band always gets at least two VPWR/VGND pairs.  On the 512x32
that is 4 + 2 + 5 pairs, 11 stripes per net for the 10 the grid gives
(Uri: any number of full-height power pins is fine).

The step ends with a tidy pass, because the abstract LEF turns every
Metal4 VPWR/VGND box into a PORT rect and the Tiny Tapeout pin check
(`tt/precheck/pin_check.py`) rejects a power port rect that stops more
than 10 um from the bottom or the top edge.  pdngen leaves three
partial-height segments between the four macros of each CFGMEM column at
every rail x (the full-height rail stripe is drawn next to them, once per
macro), and beside the IHP16 column it adds a channel-repair VGND stripe
at x 1700.64 in four pieces: the 2 um halo starts the short rows there at
x 1680, past the grid VGND stripe at 1678.17, so those 98 rows had no
other VGND feed.  Before the tidy pass the final LEF had 94 of 141 power
port rects failing that rule.  Now each stripe x keeps exactly one
full-height box and one pin box; the repair stripe is extended to full
height with rail vias on the rows it newly crosses (40 pin boxes per net).  Placement rules learned: no sliver channel next to a macro
(SRAM at 7.21 left 3.84 um to the core edge: PDN-0179), keep the SRAM out
of the tile pin zone x 29.76-191.04 (Metal4 pin stubs on a 3.84 um pitch
that no 44.96 grid interleaves with), and 2 um horizontal macro halo
(KLayout NW.b: n-well spacing 1.24 um where cells abut the SRAM).

| band variant                                                 | GRT overflow |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| SRAM at 187 (pocket to its west filled with TinyQV)          | 13764        |
| SRAM flush left, both rows facing the 22.68 um gap           | 5341         |
| SRAM bottom right (1284.72), lower row pins facing down      | 3643         |

| 60 um gap, column D lower macro facing the gap               | 4483 (10% more wire: the band ate 65k um2 of cell area) |
| as row 3 but only column D's lower macro facing the gap (v6)  | 2884, DRT to 0 in 12 iterations, KLayout DRC 0, LVS clean, typ +0.38 ns / hold +0.002 ns |

Row 3 (v4) ran detailed routing to a plateau of 357 violations, every one
of them inside the SRAM footprint: the hi programming chain from column
D's downward-facing lower macro to column C dived through the SRAM because
the corridor above it also held the wrapper and the SRAM pins.  Nothing
else in the band layout was left unrouted, hence v6.

**Plan of record (2026-09-14 evening): the two-column layout on the
44.96 um grid.**  LEFT16 column at x 537.11 (117 um corridor to the
SRAMs), IHP16 column at 1346.39 (478 um channel), `FP_PDN_VOFFSET` 6.15,
2 um horizontal halo, KLayout DRC instead of Magic DRC (`src/config.json`;
the tile-level keys come from tt_tool).  First with one 1024x32 SRAM flush
left: GRT overflow 1734, DRT 24445 12066 10839 1093 73 0 (five
iterations), typ setup +0.59 ns, KLayout DRC 0 items over 333 rules, LVS
"circuits match uniquely" with all counts zero.  Then, for Ethernet
receive and transmit at once, two 512x32 SRAMs (one FIFO per shard,
section 4i) stacked flush left with their pin faces toward each other,
(3.36, 3.78) `FS` and (3.36, 340.20) `N` (294.84 until the tracer; section 4m), both wrappers in the 145 um gap:
GRT 2560, DRT 26348 13229 11974 1492 289 12 3 3 0, typ setup +0.68 ns,
hold +0.06 ns, slow-corner WNS -6.82 (all three better than with the
single macro), KLayout DRC 0, LVS clean.  All the 1P x32 macros share the
416.64 um width and the same power-column positions, so the stripes on
the lower macro's columns serve the upper one; the stripe step must
only ever delete vias that sit on stripes it actually removes, or the
second macro's pass strips the rows above the stack of their power (the
IR-drop connectivity check catches that).  Magic's
extraction still reports 22 "illegal overlap between obsm4 and metal4":
the VPWR stripes crossing the LEF keep-out bar at each VDD column's
VDD!/VDDARRAY! break (LEF y 39-45), where the GDS has no metal at all, so
`ERROR_ON_ILLEGAL_OVERLAPS` is 0 with that reason in the config.  The
band layouts are kept in `src/config_band*.json` for the day a CONST SRAM
needs the space; the regenerated macros and the grid serve both.

**Band v6 recipe (kept for a rainy day).**  If a later addition (PRISM
tracing into the SRAM, a CONST lookup SRAM) pushes the column POR off the
routing cliff, the band layout is the fallback and `src/config_band_v6.json`
holds it verbatim: CFGMEM 2x2 band at the top on the 44.96 um grid, rows
619.92 (N) and 510.30, columns 87.51 / 447.19 / 941.75 / 1301.43 (the POR
bank assignment of section 4d); the lower row upright (`N`, pins facing
down into the logic) except column D, whose lower macro is flipped (`FS`,
pins into the 22.68 um gap) because the SRAM sits below it; SRAM bottom
right at (1284.72, 3.78) `FS`; `FP_PDN_VOFFSET` 6.15, `FP_PDN_VSPACING`
3.52, 2 um halo, KLayout DRC.  Things that made it worse and need not be
retried: the SRAM anywhere but a corner (pocket), both rows facing the gap
(the POR arrangement), a 60 um gap, and a lower target density.  Run it
directly with `python -m librelane ... src/config_band_v6.json` (the file
carries the tile keys tt_tool merges for `make harden-tt`).

**Signoff with the SRAM.**  Magic DRC reports 2.2 million violations
inside the macro (it has no notion of the bit cells) and is not what the
Tiny Tapeout precheck runs for ihp-sg13cmos5l; the precheck runs the
PDK's KLayout deck, so the local flow does too (`RUN_MAGIC_DRC` 0,
`RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC` 1 with the IHP-Open-PDK dev-branch runset).  That deck
is clean on every FEOL table with the SRAM in the tile.  netgen writes the
SRAM's `VDD!`/`VSS!`/`VDDARRAY!` names into its LVS JSON with a stray
backslash, which made the LibreLane LVS step die in the JSON parser;
`librelane_plugin_prism_pdn.py` gives that step a repairing loader.  The
column-grid run above is the first clean DRC + LVS with the SRAM in the
tile.  The precheck's pin check also needs every VPWR/VGND port rect on
Metal4, at least 2.1 um wide and within 10 um of both edges; the local
flow does not run it, so check `runs/wokwi/final/lef` for short power
rects after any PDN change (see the tidy pass above).

### 4d.2 Floorplan experiment: a macro in the top row (2026-09-16, run 14)

Tried after run 13: `CFGMEMS_LEFT[1].cfgmem_lo` moved out of the left
column to the top row at (941.75, 619.92) N (pins south, on the 44.96
um stripe grid between `LEFT[1].cfgmem_hi` and `CFGMEMS[3].cfgmem_hi`),
and `CFGMEMS_LEFT[0].cfgmem_hi` raised 9 rows to y 291.06 so its channel
grew to 200 um.  Global routing liked it: wirelength 2.83 M um (3.01 in
run 13), Metal3 usage 71.4% / overflow 2438 (76.6% / 5621), Metal2
overflow 795 (1590), and the Metal3 demand map (`tools/route_heat.py`)
flatter, its busiest bin 15% lower.  Detailed routing did not: the
count tracked run 13 to iteration 12, then fell behind (342 flat for
three passes, a 1112 bounce on the wide ripup against run 13's 639, 93
at iteration 32 where run 13 had 6), with a persistent set of Metal4
signal shorts run 13 never showed.  The power stripes over the moved
macro were checked and sit exactly on its rails, so those shorts are
routing, most likely the split lo/hi pair's mux nets crossing the top
stripe.  Stopped at iteration 32 and reverted to the run 13 floorplan;
the global-routing gain says the idea has merit, but not in this form.

## 4e. Bank addressing when unfractured (timing)

Unfractured, shard 1's state index register tracks the low bits of
shard 0's (`next_si[1] = next_si[0][3:0]`), so bank B is always addressed
by shard 1's register and bank A by shard 0's: no mux on either row
address, and `cfg_fractured` is off the address path.  Shard 0's SI MSB
then selects which bank's STEW feeds the decision trees, a mux whose
select is a registered bit.  Consequences: STATUS shows shard 1's SI
following shard 0 while unfractured, and shard 1's debugger has no
effect until the PRISM is fractured.  The unit test forces states 4, 15,
20 and 31 through the debugger and checks the STEW read back from the
right bank.

## 4f. CFGMEM programming chains (per bank)

Each bank's four macros form a shift chain that stays inside the bank's
macro block: host word -> lo0 -> lo1 -> lo2 -> lo3 and host word -> hi0 ->
hi1 -> hi2 -> hi3 (macro i's `Di0` is macro i-1's `Do0`).  A macro's `Do0`
is its addressed row, or its `Di0` while the bank's bypass bit (control
byte bit 6 for lo, bit 7 for hi) is set, so with the bypass set every macro
of the chain sees the host word and is shifted with its own write strobe
(0x00 + 4i for lo i, 0x20 + 4i for hi i).  Loading is therefore one write
per word with the bank's bypass set, in any macro order.  Reads return each
macro's own `Do0` (0x00 + 4i = lo i, 0x20 + 4i = hi i) at the row selected
by the control byte when address-select is set, with the bypass clear.
With the bypass clear a shift of macro i copies macro i-1's addressed row
into row 0 of macro i, which `cfgmem_verify` uses to walk both chains.
Only the chain input word of each bank leaves the block, so the 2x2 macro
blocks need no lo-to-hi data wiring.

## 4g. in_prev edge capture (decision 2, 2026-09-13)

Each shard has four edge-capture flops on inputs 16-19.  CFG1[4i+3:4i]
names the edge-capable input flop i follows: a ui_in pin (0-6, after the
shard's sync select) or a host_in bit (8, 9).  A flop captures its source
in exactly the cycle a decision tree whose muxes read that source fires
and the transition is executed: tree 0 when it matches, tree 1 when it
matches and tree 0 does not (the else-if is actually taken).  Nothing is
captured while the shard is halted or in the cycle a conditional
breakpoint fires, and a single step captures on that one executed cycle,
so the debugger sees the same sequence as free running.  Transitions
taken by the auto-loop (`inc` / `loop_si`) do not capture, since no tree
read the input.

The idiom: `if (pin ^ in_prev0) -> next` fires once per transition of the
pin, because the jump re-captures in_prev0 to the pin's new value.  Two
edge-capable inputs can be watched from one state through tree 0 and tree
1 (`chroma_edge` in the unit test counts ui_in[2] transitions in count2 and
host_in[0] toggles in count1 this way).  A flop whose source is not read by
the firing tree keeps its value, so several states can share one edge
condition without re-arming each other.  Program the CFG1 sources before
enabling the PRISM: a flop only changes on a capture, so a source changed
while running leaves the old value behind until the next firing tree that
reads the new source (and with the reset source 0, the first jump of any
tree whose spare mux selects input 0 loads every flop with ui_in[0]).
OUT_LATCH and `latched_in` (inputs 12-13) are unchanged.

## 4h. USB low-speed device chroma: the stretch-goal evaluation (2026-09-14)

`chromas/chroma_usb_ls.v` with the host model `test/user_peripherals/prism/
usb_model.py` is the first stretch-goal chroma, written to find what the
core lacks.  It is a 1.5 Mbit/s device on ui_in[4:5] and uo_out[2:4]
(D+, D-, output enable for external tri-state buffers), 40 clocks per bit
at the test clock.  It receives SETUP / OUT tokens and DATA packets (NRZI
decode, bit un-stuffing, CRC16 residual check, payload and CRC pushed to
FIFO A), answers with ACK, answers IN from the response the CPU queued in
FIFO B (PID, payload, CRC16) or with NAK, and handles the host's ACK.  The
test runs a GET_DESCRIPTOR setup, a NAKed IN, a 4-byte IN response and a
bit-stuffed OUT.  `TESTCASE=test_usb_device` runs just this test.

Features added to make it fit (all in the register maps above):

- shifter input from cond_out[0] (CFG0[28]): the FSM computes the NRZI
  bit (`D- == in_prev1`) in the sampling state and shifts it in;
- FSM flags: OUT_LATCH stores the two conditional outputs and output 19
  (CFG0[29]) - the receive / transmit phase lives in them;
- constant table CONST with OUT_COMM_LOAD select (CFG0[30]): sync 0x80,
  ACK 0xD2, NAK 0x5A without a state sequence per byte;
- input slots CFG2: the trees read comm[3:0] to decode the PID and flag2;
- CRC byte transmit through comm (not used by this chroma, the CPU
  supplies the response CRC; needed for Ethernet FCS and a full USB TX).

What the chroma does with the datapath: count1 is the half-bit timer
(two terminal counts per bit so samples land on bit centres), count2 the
consecutive-ones counter for stuffing (compare = 6), the shifter's own
count gives byte boundaries, the CRC unit checks CRC16 with the residual
0xB001, FIFO A receives, FIFO B transmits (the two-FIFO mode of 4b), the
line level of the transmitter is a J / K pair of states with the level
also on the conditional outputs so the last bit can be held from flag F0.

Findings, in order of weight:

1. **States: 32 of 32.**  Receive engine 6, dispatch 6, EOP 3, transmit
   engine 12, hold and EOP 5.  Two things cost the most: every condition
   beyond two per state costs a state (three-way decisions are split), and
   the transmit engine is duplicated per line level because outputs are
   per state.  A third decision tree, or an output word that could depend
   on a flag, would each save about six states here.
2. **Not implemented for lack of room:** address match on tokens (the
   comm == K3 input exists), CRC5 on tokens (the CRC unit has one
   configuration; a second polynomial / width set selectable by an output
   is the fix), DATA0 / DATA1 toggle tracking, resynchronisation on edges
   during a packet (a wait state would need three conditions: timer,
   edge, SE0; real hardware needs it for the +/-1.5% clock tolerance),
   the TX CRC16 (the CPU computes it; the CRC byte transmit is there).
3. **The auto-loop rule shapes wait states:** a state entered by `inc`
   returns to the inc state when no tree fires, so a wait state must
   never be an inc target.  Chroma authors need this in the manual.
4. **A per-shard register table** (VID / PID, descriptors, MAC / IP
   addresses) with an FSM-stepped index would let the device answer
   GET_DESCRIPTOR without the CPU; CONST is the 4-byte version of it, and
   the SRAM is the natural backing for a longer one.
5. **Counters were enough** for USB: bit timer, stuff counter, shift
   count.  A third counter was not needed here; Ethernet may still want
   one for frame bytes unless the SRAM pointer serves.
6. The input synchroniser delay matters when the FSM reads its own drive
   back (the hold state first tried that and locked on the old level);
   flags or state are the right source for a level the FSM set itself.

## 4i. SRAM FIFOs: one 512x32 macro per shard (2026-09-14)

`prism_sram_fifo.v` puts a byte FIFO on an IHP single-port SRAM macro,
instantiated inside the PRISM peripheral.  Parameter `SRAM_FIFO` (define
`PRISM_SRAM_FIFO` in peripherals.v) is the number of them: 2 is the plan
of record, one per shard on `RM_IHPSG13_1P_512x32_c2_bm_bist` (2 KB each,
`SRAM_AW` 9), so an Ethernet receiver in one shard and a transmitter in
the other each own a full-rate buffer; 1 keeps the earlier single shared
FIFO (shard 0 wins if both ask; `SRAM_AW` 10 or 11 for the 1024x32 /
2048x32 macro); 0 builds without any macro.  A shard makes its SRAM FIFO
its FIFO with CFG0[31]: the shard's push / pop strobes, head byte, count
and flags then come from the SRAM FIFO and its flop FIFO idles, so a
chroma sees no difference except the depth (status count field widened
to [21:8]) and the almost-empty / almost-full levels, which are in
64-byte units.  With the two-FIFO mode of 4b, unfractured shard 0 reaches
shard 1's SRAM as FIFO B, so one shard can hold a 2 KB RX buffer and a
2 KB TX buffer at once.

Inside: four bytes per word, whole-word accesses only.  Pushes assemble
a word in a register and the fourth byte writes it (writes have the
port); a cached head word means pops within a word cost no access.  A
pop that leaves the word reads the next one at once (one clock later if
a word is being written that clock) and reports `empty` for the two or
three clocks until the data is back; while the reader is inside the word
still being assembled the head comes straight from that register, and a
write to the reader's word refreshes the cache.  Words complete at most
every four clocks, so no write is ever queued and a push is refused only
when `full`.  (The first version kept a four-entry byte queue with
per-byte writes and merges: 20k um2 of cells, more than both flop FIFOs;
this one is about 10k.)
The read data of the macro is registered (one clock).  The unit test
(`SramFifoTest`) pushes and pops through the shard windows, fills both
SRAM FIFOs at once and flushes one, and runs the fifo_loop chroma in
both directions across many word boundaries.

Simulation uses the PDK's behavioural model with `FUNCTIONAL` defined
(A_DLY tied high, BIST tied off); synthesis sees the black box in
`sram_2048x32_bb.v`.  The macro's power hookup and placement are in 4d /
section 7: two-column CFGMEM layout, SRAM on the left with the tile
stripes drawn on its own tracks.

## 4j. Ethernet transmitter chroma: the second stretch-goal evaluation (2026-09-14)

`chromas/chroma_eth_tx.v` with the decoder model `test/user_peripherals/
prism/eth_model.py` sends 10BASE-T frames from the SRAM FIFO (4i): TXD on
uo_out[1] from cond_out[0], TX_EN on uo_out[2], six clocks per bit at the
test clock (three per half bit, count1 as the half-bit timer with preload
2).  Manchester coding costs no decision: the line is the LUT
`shift_data ^ first_half`, so a bit is two states that advance on the
timer, and the shift, pop and CRC update ride on those transitions.  The
frame is four 0x55 from constant K0, four bytes from the FIFO (the host
queues 55 55 55 D5 in front of the frame), the frame bytes with the CRC32
running on every bit, the four FCS bytes from the CRC unit through comm
(one OUT_LOAD_CRC per byte, low byte first), TP_IDL for two bit times,
the host interrupt.  count2 counts bytes or half bits in each phase
against compare = 3.  A toggle of host_in[0] starts a frame and a toggle
of host_in[1] sends a link pulse, both through the in_prev edge capture.
Sixteen states.  The test sends a 64-byte and a 300-byte frame (the
latter streamed from the SRAM FIFO, which refills its head word in the
gaps) and a link pulse; the decoder checks every byte and the FCS.

Findings:

1. **Transmit fits with room to spare**: 16 of 32 states, and the datapath
   kept up at six clocks per bit with a byte pop every 48 clocks, so a
   hardware Manchester encoder is not needed for transmit.
2. **The CRC must be updated mid-bit**: updating at the end of the bit,
   in the same transition that loads the first FCS byte, hands the load
   the value before the last bit.  Mid-bit updates are the natural fix
   and cost nothing.
3. **One preload is one timer**: the 16 ms link-pulse interval cannot live
   in count1 while count1 is the half-bit timer, so the CPU asks for
   pulses.  A second preload, or a free-running timer input, would let
   the chroma keep the link alive alone.  The same applies to the 9.6 us
   inter-frame gap.  (Answered: PRELOAD2, section 4l; the inter-frame gap
   can use count1, which is idle between frames.)
4. **count2 as the phase counter** worked because every phase happens to
   be four long (preamble halves, FCS bytes, TP_IDL half bits); a second
   compare value or a third counter would remove that coincidence.
5. **The 32-bit CRC mode is a CFG0 bit that is easy to miss**: the first
   run produced a 16-bit FCS padded with 0xFF.  The chroma CFG0 constants
   deserve named fields in the compiler's cfg.
6. Receive is the open question: classifying 3- versus 6-clock edge
   intervals with two-flop synchronised inputs and one decision per clock
   is where a hardware decoder or a faster clock would be needed.
   (Answered in 4k with the Manchester bit recoverer.)

## 4k. Ethernet receiver: the stretch goal closed in RTL (2026-09-14)

Receive needed two small datapath additions (section 4j, finding 6):

- **A Manchester bit recoverer per shard** (`prism_mrx.v`, CFG3 at +0x3C:
  [2:0] the PRISM input carrying the line, [3] enable, [7:4] clocks per
  half bit, [8] shifter input = the recovered bit).  It runs on the PRISM
  clock; an edge on the synchronised line is accepted when three quarters
  of a bit (hb + hb/2 clocks) have passed since the last accepted edge, so
  the boundary transition between two equal bits is skipped and every
  mid-bit edge re-times the decoder; the level after the accepted edge is
  the bit.  Its "bit valid" is CFG2 slot code 15 and stays set until the
  FSM's shift consumes it, so a two-state receive loop never misses a bit.
  About 25 flops per shard; the FSM keeps every decision (SFD, bytes,
  CRC, end of frame).
- **The shifter can take that bit as its input**, and with the reflected
  CRC32 taking the shifter input bit, one transition per received bit
  does shift + CRC + count.

`chromas/chroma_eth_rx.v` is four states: WAIT (a bit: shift and reload
the idle timer; idle: keep comm clear from K0 = 0), CHK (comm[7:6] = 1, 1:
the SFD just ended, so clear the CRC and the bit counter), DWAIT (a bit:
shift, CRC, count, reload the timer; timer terminal: end of frame, host
interrupt, clear comm), DCHK (eight bits: push comm into the FIFO).  The
preamble / SFD needs no comparator: 0x55 .. 0xD5 sent LSB first are
strictly alternating until the two 1s that end the SFD, and comm[7:6] are
inputs through slot codes 12 and 11.  The FCS is checked by the host
(or a chroma) through `crc_ok`: CRC_EXPECTED = 0xDEBB20E3, the CRC32
residue after data + FCS.  A partial last byte is dropped; a link pulse
is one bit that never becomes an SFD and times out.

Tests: `EthernetRxTest` (link pulse ignored, a 64-byte frame, a 300-byte
frame from a line 8% slower than the clock, a corrupted FCS reported) and
`EthernetLoopTest`: eth_tx in shard 0 on SRAM 0 and eth_rx in shard 1 on
SRAM 1, fractured, with TXD looped into ui_in[3] by the bench; the host
queues a frame in shard 0 and reads it back from shard 1 with crc_ok.
That is the stretch goal in RTL: transmit and receive at once on one
PRISM with the two SRAM FIFOs.  Still to do: the FPGA / board level
(differential receiver and driver behind the magnetics), destination
filtering (software or the CONST table), and the 16 ms link pulses (a
second timer, finding 3 of 4j).

### 4k.1 Double-edge sampling (2026-09-17)

CFG3[9] samples the receive pin on both clock edges: a falling-edge flop
on the raw pin, then a two-flop synchroniser for each of the two samples
so their order into the recoverer is fixed whatever CFG0's input sync
setting, and `prism_mrx` processes the two samples of a clock one after
the other with the blanking interval counted in half clocks.  [7:4] then
holds half clocks per half bit: 6 at 64 MHz, 5 at 50 MHz.  Nothing
downstream changes; bits still reach the FSM one per bit time.  The gain
is edge resolution, 7.8 ns instead of 15.6 ns at 64 MHz, which doubles
the tight side of the recoverer's margin (the bit-boundary edge has to
fall inside the blanking window, the next mid-bit edge outside it):

| Sampling                                  | Boundary-edge margin | Mid-bit-edge margin |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 64 MHz single edge, hb = 3                | 12.5 ns              | 22 ns               |
| 64 MHz both edges, hb = 6                 | 20 ns                | 22 ns               |
| 50 MHz single edge, hb = 2                | 10 ns                | 20 ns               |
| 50 MHz both edges, hb = 5                 | 20 ns                | 20 ns               |

The 50 MHz rows are the reason beyond margin: if silicon timing forces
a slower tile clock, 10BASE-T receive keeps working with real margin.
Cost: five flops per shard and one falling-edge flop on the clock (the
TinyQV top already has one for its reset synchroniser).  Tested in
`test_ethernet_rx`: a 300-byte frame from a line 12% slow at 6 half
clocks per half bit, then a 50 MHz clock emulated by 2.5 clocks per
half bit (the encoder alternates 2 and 3) with an 8% slow line.

A 125 MHz sampling clock from an all-digital PLL locked to a PHY's
25 MHz reference would give the same resolution; it was evaluated the
same day and kept as a separate experiment (a hand-placed ring
oscillator macro built like the DFFRAM / CFGMEM flow), since the ring
of the sky130 design it would start from is sized for that library and
its output could only clock a sampler, never the FSM.

## 4l. The second timer: PRELOAD2 (2026-09-14)

A free-running 24-bit timer per shard (`PRELOAD2` at +0x40): it reloads
itself and raises PRISM input 28 for one clock every PRELOAD2 + 1 clocks
(0 = off).  Input 28 was a spare whose CFG2 default was a constant 0; the
tick is now that default, so no slot code and no output bit were needed.
Nothing in the FSM starts or reloads it, which is the point: it paces
things while count1 is busy.  `chroma_eth_tx` sends a link pulse on the
tick as well as on the host's toggle (`nlp_tick | (host1 ^ in_prev1)`;
the compiler wants the bitwise form, `||` with a `!=` inside is rejected),
so with PRELOAD2 = 959999 at 60 MHz the link stays alive with no CPU
help, and a frame in flight simply ignores ticks (the FSM is not in IDLE).
Test: four pulses in four periods, none with the timer off, a frame
transmitted intact with the timer ticking.  SDK: `prism_set_timer2()`.

Restart on state entry (2026-09-15): with PRELOAD2[24] the count also
restarts from the period whenever the shard enters state PRELOAD2[29:25]
(the core's next SI is that state and the current SI is not: the first
clock of a visit, so a state that loops on itself restarts it once, and
a debugger step into the state restarts it too), which makes the tick a
retriggerable timeout - "nothing for N clocks since the last entry into
RX_BIT" - with no STEW bits and no chroma code, since input 28 is the
tick as before.  Without [30] the timer free-runs after the timeout
(a tick every period until the next entry); with [30] (one-shot) it
ticks once per timeout and then waits for the next entry, so a burst of
entries closer than the period ends in exactly one tick.  Writing a
period of 0 stops and clears it.  Test: `test_timer2` replays the
counter and its tick clock by clock against a model of the register for
free-running, restart and one-shot, on shard 0 (pin edges entering
CNT_PIN) and on shard 1 while fractured (host toggles entering
CNT_HOST).  SDK: `prism_set_timer2_retrigger(clocks, state, one_shot)`.

If a future feature does need an FSM output rather than an input, the
escape hatch is to widen the STEW with instantiated latches strobed by
the existing WROW lines: not as dense as the CFGMEM bits, but a couple of
outputs times three branches is a few dozen latches per shard.

## 4m. Trace: execution capture into the SRAMs (2026-09-15)

Each shard has a tracer (`prism_periph.v`, registers +0x44 / +0x48).
From its trigger on, every clock's `{executing, tree 1 taken, tree 0
matched, the six selected LUT mux input bits, SI[4:0]}` - a 16-bit entry,
two per SRAM word - is written into an SRAM by the SRAM's trace port
(`prism_trace_port.v`, next to the macro) until the buffer is full (1024
entries on the 512x32; `2^(SRAM_AW+1)`), and the host reads the entries
back.  The 21 outputs of a traced clock are not stored: they follow from
the entry and the chroma the host loaded (state outputs at STEW bits
[61:41], tree 1 outputs [82:62], tree 0 outputs [103:83]; while halted
the outputs were the debugger's), and `prism_trace_outputs()` in the SDK
rebuilds them; the test checks that rebuild against the real outputs on
every traced clock.  The triggers: at once; in a given state; that state
taking either jump (a decision tree fires while the shard executes, so a
halted shard does not trigger); or an edge (rising, falling, either) on
any of the 32 PRISM inputs.  Entry 0 is the trigger cycle itself: in the
"state" case the first cycle in the state, in the "jump" case the cycle
the tree fires (its match bit set, entry 1 is the target state), in the
"edge" case the cycle the input changed.

Storage: one shard traces at a time.  Shard s traces into SRAM s while
its `TRACE_CFG[0]` is set (shard 0 wins if both shards enable: shard 1's
tracer then reports inactive until shard 0's is switched off); with
`TRACE_CFG[1]` as well it takes both SRAMs as one 2048-entry buffer
(entries 0..1023 in SRAM 0); with `TRACE_CFG[6]` ("other", 2026-09-15)
it traces into the other shard's SRAM instead of its own, so a chroma
streaming a frame from its SRAM FIFO (Ethernet TX, or RX filling it) can
be traced while it does so, the entries then read through the other
shard's window.  A single 16-bit bus and three strobes, registered once
at the top of the peripheral from the tracing shard's signals, reach the
SRAM trace ports; "other" only changes which SRAM's port takes them and
which SRAM's `full` the shard watches.  Arming flushes the traced SRAM's
FIFO and pushes into a traced SRAM are dropped, so a chroma cannot
stream from the SRAM being traced into - use the flop FIFO, or the other
SRAM.

Host sequence: TRACE_CFG (trigger, storage), TRACE_CTRL = 1 (arm: the
buffer restarts at entry 0 and the SRAM's FIFO is flushed), wait for done
(or stop with TRACE_CTRL = 2, which keeps what was recorded, an odd
count included), then read the entries as FIFO bytes.  At the end of a
capture the trace port hands the buffer to the SRAM FIFO wrapper
(`prism_sram_fifo.v` `load`: count x 2 bytes from word 0 become its
contents), and while an SRAM holds a finished trace the window that reads
that SRAM sees it as its SRAM FIFO in RX mode whatever CFG0 says, so
`FIFO_STATUS` shows count x 2 bytes and each read of +0x20 pops the next
byte, entry by entry, low byte first; with both SRAMs, entries 1024 and
up come through shard 1's window.  Until the
capture is done the window's FIFO works as configured (a chroma on the
flop FIFO runs untouched while it is being traced); pushes into a traced
SRAM are dropped.  Switching the trace off, or arming again, gives the
window its FIFO back.  SDK: `prism_trace_config()`, `prism_trace_arm()`,
`prism_trace_wait()`, `prism_trace_read()` (four pops), `prism_trace_off()`,
`PRISM_TRACE_SI/MUX/OUT()`.

Why the entries are 16 bits and the readout goes through the FIFO: the
tile has one horizontal routing layer (Metal3) and it was at 71% before
the tracer.  The first version stored 32-bit entries `{out, mux, SI}` and
had TRACE_ADDR / TRACE_DATA registers with a prefetched read path from
the SRAMs back into each shard: some 150 nets per shard between the shard
logic (right of centre, next to the CFGMEM columns) and the SRAMs at the
far left, and the placer dragged both shards 200-340 um towards the
SRAMs (global-route wirelength 2.75M -> 3.30M um, overflow 4378 ->
19735, Metal3 at 89%, with or without flops on the SRAM port: the pull is
connectivity, not timing).  Reading through the FIFO wrapper instead
brought the shards back to their places but 46 crossing nets per shard
still left the overflow at 13434 with Metal3 at 81%, the extra demand
spread over the whole left two thirds of the tile by the
routability-driven placer.  Dropping the outputs from the entry (they are
a function of the STEW) halved the bus and doubled the depth, but with
both shards tracing at once (16 data bits and three strobes per shard,
two buses) the overflow was still 6664 and detailed routing plateaued
near 2000 violations.  So one shard traces at a time: a single 16-bit bus
with three strobes crosses the tile, from flops, with `full` coming
back, and the counter and the word packing sit next to the SRAM in the
trace port.  The last stalls (single shard, 16 bits: detailed routing
oscillating between 35 and 90 violations) were at the exits of the gaps
between the LEFT16 column's macros (x 840-870, y 105-240 and x 735-810,
y 465-600): everything from the SRAM side funnels through those gaps,
and 21 more nets in that bundle were enough.  To pay for them the SRAM
FIFO wrapper's almost-empty / almost-full levels (8 bits out) and flags
(2 back) per shard no longer cross: the shard compares its own CFG1
levels against the count that crosses anyway, and the flop FIFO storage
became latch rows (fewer cells in the shard region).

Cost: per shard a 21-bit configuration latch register (write-only) and
some 10 flops of state; one set of 16 + 3 bus flops; per SRAM the trace
port (an 11-bit counter, a 16-bit holding register) and the write mux on
the macro port; the core exports its SI, mux outputs and tree results
(`trace_*` ports).  Synthesized area 286k um2 against 281k before the
tracer, after the flop FIFOs became latch rows (section 4b note) and the
wrapper's flag comparisons moved to the shard.

Closing the tile with the tracer took ten hardens (2026-09-15, log in
this section and 4d.1): the routing limit of this floorplan is the pair
of gaps between the macros of each CFGMEM column and the corridor between
the two SRAMs.  The final recipe, all in `src/config.json`: SRAM 1 at y
340.20 (corridor 145 um), routing obstructions over both SRAM interiors
on Metal2-4 with 2.6 um free at the pin faces (the global router had
planned two corridor nets through the macros), the macro LEFs
regenerated with no pin clearance towards the macro interior (a 0.02 um
Metal3 spacing item at a WROW pin), and `PL_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN`
0.25 ns (run 9 closed physically but 3.6 ps short at the typical corner
on a shard-flop-to-SRAM-pin path).  Run 10: routing 0, KLayout DRC 0,
LVS clean, IR drop 0.78 / 0.40 mV, typical setup +0.50 ns / hold +0.21
ns, fast-corner hold +0.03 ns, 80 power ports legal; one antenna net left
after the three repair passes (a warning, not a precheck item).  Run 11
(the "other SRAM" option and the timer restart, 2026-09-15): routing 0
in 20 iterations, one antenna re-route pass, antenna 0, KLayout DRC 0,
LVS clean, IR drop 0.86 / 0.65 mV, typical setup +0.59 ns / hold +0.25
ns, fast-corner hold +0.08 ns, 80 power ports legal; +11k um2 of
standard cells over run 10 (2.8%, mostly antenna cells and hold
buffers; the logic itself is 1.8k um2), the same slow-corner setup
warning as run 10 (-7.3 ns at 125 C / 1.08 V against the 14 ns TT
constraint).  Test:
`test_trace` checks every trigger, the stop (odd count), both SRAMs as
one buffer (all 1024 entries of SRAM 0 and the first of SRAM 1 through
shard 1's window), the FIFO around a trace, shard 0 tracing into SRAM 1
while its SRAM 0 FIFO keeps its bytes (the entries through shard 1's
window, a push into SRAM 1 dropped), shard 0 then shard 1 tracing the
same kind of edge while fractured (shard 0 wins while both enable), and
the host's output reconstruction, all against a golden record of the
core taps sampled every clock.

## 4n. Constant table: the latch FIFO as addressable constants (2026-09-15)

When a shard streams from its SRAM FIFO (CFG0[31]) its 16x8 latch FIFO
sits idle; `CONST_TAB` (+0x4C) turns those 16 rows into constants a
chroma indexes - a MAC address, an IP header, a fixed reply - without
spending states on OUT_K_SEL bit patterns for every byte.  With
CONST_TAB[0] set, OUT_COMM_LOAD loads comm from the row at a 4-bit
index (flops) instead of preload[7:0] or K[]; the two constant-select
outputs become the index mode for that load: `{OUT_K_SEL1, OUT_K_SEL0}`
= 0 clears the index, 1 adds one, 2 adds `add_to_idx` (CONST_TAB[10:8]),
3 loads `idx_load` (CONST_TAB[7:4]) - or adds it with CONST_TAB[1], so
a chroma that needs two strides and no jump can have them.  Every load
moves the index (add 0 if it must not).  The byte loaded is the row
*after* the move, so "clear" reads row 0, "+1" the next row, "load"
the row jumped to, all in the same load; CONST_TAB[2] (post) reads the
row *before* the move instead, for chromas that want a plain
post-increment walk.  The index wraps modulo 16.  A write to CONST_TAB
also sets the index from [19:16] (the host's reset before a run), and
[19:16] read back live.  The comm match against K3 (CONST[31:24]) is
untouched, and CONST's K[] loads still work with the table off.

The table is loaded the way the flop FIFO is: select it (CFG0[31] = 0)
in TX mode, flush, push 16 bytes, then select the SRAM FIFO again - the
latch rows keep their contents (`prism_const_table_load()` does exactly
that and restores CFG0).  In table mode the FIFO's head is the indexed
row, so with the flop FIFO selected the host sees a row at +0x20: the
row at the index while the shard is not executing (disabled or halted)
or with post set, otherwise the row the executing shard's current
outputs would load next (an idle chroma's outputs say "clear": row 0).
The FIFO pointers are not otherwise touched, so a chroma using the
table must not also pop that FIFO.  Cost: a 4-bit register and adder per shard and a second
select on the existing 16:1 head mux (`prism_fifo.v` `tab_en`,
`tab_idx`).  Test: `test_const_table` with `chroma_const_tab` (six
loads: clear, +1, +1, +add, load/add idx_load, +1; pushed into the SRAM
FIFO and read back) checks pre and post update, the add-idx_load
option, wrap-around, a preset index, the read-back, the host's view of
a row, and the same loads from K[] with the table off.  SDK:
`prism_const_table_load()`, `prism_const_table()`,
`prism_const_table_index()`, `PRISM_CTAB_*`.

Hardening (2026-09-15/16): run 12, the first with the table, stopped at
6 shorts after 60 router passes, all in one 30 x 35 um pocket of shard
1's constant / CFG2 logic.  The pocket was only 37% utilized; what
filled it was 59 antenna diodes, 16 of them on two mux-select nets,
crowding the pin access of the cells between them (the diode total was
the same as run 11's, about 11k; the placement had simply landed them
together).  `tools/route_heat.py` and `tools/cell_density.py` (maps of
Metal2/3 demand from the routing guides and of cell density from an
.odb) showed the general pressure to be the two channel-height stripes
of the band between the CFGMEM columns, at 60% utilization against the
55% target, with Metal3 the only horizontal signal layer (the PDK's
LibreLane default excludes Metal1, `RT_MIN_LAYER`, and Tiny Tapeout
reserves TopMetal1).  Fix: pad the diodes.  LibreLane's `DIODE_PADDING`
turned out to have no effect here - it is declared for the routing
steps, but the 10.9k heuristic diodes are legalized by a
DetailedPlacement sub-step that never sees it (run 13a was bit-identical
to run 12) - so the config now sets `DPL_CELL_PADDING` 2 (one site each
side) with a `CELL_PAD_EXCLUDE` list of 28 star-only patterns that
strips the padding from every master except `sg13cmos5l_antennanp`
(checked against all 87 library masters; star-only because the Tcl and
Python matchers differ on anything else).  Run 13: routing 0 in 37
passes plus a clean antenna re-route, KLayout DRC 0, LVS clean, antenna
0, IR drop 0.67 mV, typical setup +0.33 ns / hold +0.27 ns, fast hold
+0.10 ns, 80 power ports legal, the same slow-corner setup warning as
before (-7.7 ns at 125 C / 1.08 V against the 14 ns constraint); 1202
hold buffers this time (280 in run 11), std-cell area 418.8k um2.  The
worst typical path is state flops -> CFGMEM decoder -> decision-tree
logic, as before, not the table's adder and row select.

## 4o. I2C master chroma (2026-09-16)

`chromas/chroma_i2c_master.v`: an I2C controller for a board with two
external open-drain (tri-state) buffers.  Each line gets one PRISM
output meaning "pull the line low" - 1 = the buffer drives the line
low, 0 = released - so the idle value of an unset output releases the
bus, and the line levels come back on ui_in pins:

| signal | pin | function |
|---|---|---|
| pin_out[0] | uo_out[1] | SCL pull-low |
| cond_out[0] | uo_out[2] | SDA pull-low (the data bit is `cond_out[0] = 1; if (shift_data) cond_out[0] = 0`) |
| in[0] | ui_in[0] | SDA level, also the shifter's input (shift_in_sel = 0) |
| in[2] | ui_in[2] | SCL level (unused so far: no clock stretching); not ui_in[1], see below |

A board note that applies to both I2C chromas: TinyQV samples ui_in[1]
at reset and, if it is high, switches on its debug register-data mode,
which takes over uo_out[5:2] (project.v).  A pulled-up bus line on
ui_in[1] would therefore hijack the PRISM's outputs at power-up, so SCL
is read on ui_in[2].  (The unit tests found this the hard way: an I2C
bus model still driving ui_in[1] high in the clock before the next
test's reset put the CPU into that mode and the following test lost
uo_out[2]; the bench now forces every ui_in bit low before a reset.)

Host side, shard 0 unfractured so it owns both FIFOs (as the fifo_loop
chroma does): FIFO B (shard 1's window, CFG0 fifo_dir = TX) holds the
bytes to send, the first one the address with R/W = 0; CONST K0 holds
the address with R/W = 1 for a read; COMPARE (+0x11) the number of
bytes to read, 0 for none; CFG2[3:0] = 14 puts flag2 on input 16 (the
FSM's "read phase" flag, set with OUT_LATCH / OUT_FLAG2 when it loads
K0); PRELOAD = the SCL phase length minus one (212 at 64 MHz for about
100 kHz).  host_in[0] = 1 starts a transaction: START, every FIFO B
byte followed by the slave's ACK, then if COMPARE is not 0 a repeated
START (the first START if FIFO B was empty), K0, and COMPARE bytes read
into FIFO A (own, RX) with ACK, NAK on the last, STOP, host interrupt;
count2 counts the bytes read.  The FSM waits in DONE until host_in[0]
drops.  A NAK from the slave aborts with a STOP: the unsent bytes stay
in FIFO B and nothing lands in FIFO A, which is the host's error flag
(no status register bit was needed).

Timing: count1 paces every phase (PRELOAD + 1 clocks).  A transmitted
bit is three phases - SCL low with the bit set, SCL high, SCL low with
the bit still held, then the shift - so SDA never moves within a phase
of an SCL edge and the period is 3 x (PRELOAD + 1).  Received bits are
sampled at the end of SCL high (the shift takes the synchronized SDA);
the ACK the same way.  The state machine is 25 states (IDLE, START1/2,
TX_LOW/HIGH/FALL/CHECK, ACK_LOW/HIGH/FALL, ACK_NEXT1/2, NAK_FALL,
RS_LOW/HIGH, RX_LOW/HIGH/CHECK, MACK_LOW/HIGH/FALL, STOP_LOW/HIGH/REL,
DONE); decision states carry at most two explicit targets (the
compiler's INC / loop_si rule), and every wait state is entered by an
explicit jump.  Left out: clock stretching (SCL_in is wired but not
read), multi-master arbitration, and FIFO A back-pressure (the host
sizes COMPARE to the 16 bytes).

Test: `test_i2c_master` with the `I2cSlave` model in `models.py`, which
resolves the two lines every clock from the master's pull-lows and its
own, drives them into ui_in, decodes START / STOP / bytes, ACKs its
address and serves read data until the master NAKs.  Checked: a 3-byte
write, a 3-byte read (ACK, ACK, NAK), a register-address write with a
repeated START and a 2-byte read, a write and a read to an absent
address (NAK, STOP, the leftover byte in FIFO B, nothing in FIFO A),
the completion interrupt / DONE / IDLE sequence, and the SCL period.

## 4p. Edge-clocked sampler (2026-09-16)

The generalisation of the Manchester recoverer's trick: CFG3[27:16]
names one PRISM input (any of the 32, [21:17]) and an edge polarity
([23:22]: rising, falling, either), and on every such edge the shard's
datapath performs the chosen actions with no state transition: shift
the shifter with its configured input ([24]), count2 + 1 ([25]),
capture all four in_prev flops ([26]), count1 clear / load ([27]).
With [28] the FSM's flag2 swaps rising and falling, so one flag turns a
bidirectional protocol's sampling edge (an I2C target receives on SCL
rising and must change its outgoing bit after SCL falling; SPI slaves
likewise per mode).
The actions OR into the FSM's own outputs (one shift if both ask in
the same clock) and, like them, only act while the shard executes, so
a debugger halt freezes the sampler too.  A sticky "edge pending" flag
is set by the edge and cleared when the FSM shifts or latches
(OUT_SHIFT / OUT_LATCH), or when the sampler or the PRISM is switched
off; it is input slot code 15, shared with the recoverer's bit valid
(the two are ORed; a shard uses one or the other), and FLAGS[11] for
the host.  Cost per shard: a 32:1 mux, two flops and a few gates,
about 40 cells, and the CFG3 latches.

What it buys: a clocked slave protocol no longer spends its states on
the bit loop (wait for the edge, shift, wait for the other edge,
count); the FSM acts at byte boundaries on shift_term or count2.  The
SPI slave chroma's seven states would become about three, an I2C
slave's receive and transmit loops collapse to one wait each, and the
USB chroma's missing "resynchronise on edges" is the count1-reload
action.  The bit is also taken on the edge clock itself instead of two
to three clocks later (synchroniser plus decision), so the same
protocols run about two to three times faster; a state that no longer
has to watch the clock input keeps one input-mux slot free (the
wire_map limit).  Masters that generate their own clock gain nothing.

Test: `test_sampler` drives a clock on ui_in[1] and data on ui_in[3]
under an idle chroma: bytes shifted on rising and on falling edges,
edges counted on either polarity, a 4-clock clock period, count1
reloaded from PRELOAD and in_prev captured on an edge (white-box), the
pending flag in FLAGS and its clearing by the uart_tx chroma's shift.
SDK: `prism_set_sampler(input, edge, actions)`, `PRISM_CFG3_SMP_*`,
`PRISM_FLAG_SMP_PENDING`; `prism_set_manchester()` keeps the sampler
bits and vice versa.  Harden run 15 (sampler + I2C chroma, no other
RTL change): routing 0 in 30 passes plus a clean re-route, KLayout DRC
0, LVS clean, antenna 0, typical setup +0.62 ns / hold +0.27 ns, fast
hold +0.09 ns, 80 power ports legal, std-cell area 422.2k um2 (+3.4k
over run 13, of which the sampler is a small part: this placement
needed 243 hold buffers against run 13's 1202).

## 4q. I2C slave chroma on the sampler (2026-09-16)

`chromas/chroma_i2c_slave.v`, the sampler's first consumer: 13 states
against 25 for the master, and none of them a bit loop.  SDA comes in on
ui_in[0] (the shifter input), SCL on ui_in[2] (the sampler's clock; not
ui_in[1], see the reset note in 4o), and one output, cond_out[0] on
uo_out[2], pulls SDA low through the external open-drain buffer.  CFG3
= sampler on input 2, rising, shift + count2,
flag2 swaps the edge; CFG2 puts comm == K3, flag2 and comm[0] on inputs
17-19 (0x5ED0) with input 16 left as in_prev[0]; CONST holds the 7-bit
address in K3, 0xFF in K1 and 0 in K0; COMPARE = 7; FIFO A (own, RX)
receives what the master writes, FIFO B (shard 1's, TX) holds what it
reads; the host interrupt fires at a STOP and when the master NAKs the
last byte of a read.

How the states divide the work.  IDLE tracks SDA through in_prev[0]
with the tree-fire capture (a self-jump on every change) and takes SDA
falling while SCL is high as START: comm <= K0, count2 clear, flag2 <=
0.  ADDR_WAIT fires when count2 reaches 7 (COMPARE) and comm == K3: the
seven address bits are compared before the R/W bit arrives, so one
constant serves both directions; ADDR_RW takes the eighth bit and
latches comm[0] into flag2 (read = 1), which from then on makes the
sampler shift on SCL falling edges.  ACK1-3 hold SDA low through the
ninth clock; at its falling edge a write clears comm and count2 and
goes to the receive pair, a read pops FIFO B (or loads K1 = 0xFF).
Receive is two states that alternate every clock through the auto-loop
(A: SDA moved while SCL high, or eight edges in; B: re-capture SDA while
SCL low), because a wait state has two trees and this one needs four
conditions; RESYNC then tells a STOP (SDA high: interrupt, IDLE) from a
repeated START (re-initialise, ADDR_WAIT).  "Eight bits in" is
`count2_cmp & shift_term`, since shift_term alone is also true before
the first shift.  Transmit is one wait state with the bit on cond_out
(`1; if (shift_data) 0`), MACK1 reads the master's ACK at SCL high (NAK:
flag2 <= 0, interrupt, IDLE) and MACK_ACK pops the next byte at SCL
low, where the datapath's pop-over-shift priority discards the sampler's
shift of that same clock.

One compiler fix on the way (yosys-prism, `prism.cc`
`parseLogicExpression`): a bit-level operand inside `&&` / `||` / `!`
(`(sda ^ in_prev0) && scl`, `!(a | b)`, `x == 2'd1 || y`) used to assert
with "unexpected node type"; it now reduces the operand to a boolean the
way identifiers already were, and the slave's conditions are written in
that natural form.  Checked by compiling the slave both ways and diffing
the generated tables (identical), and by rebuilding every chroma
(unchanged).

Test: `test_i2c_slave` with the `I2cMaster` model in `models.py`
(open-drain resolution every clock, `send_start` / `write_byte` /
`read_byte` / `send_stop`): a 3-byte write, a NAK for another address, a
3-byte read ending in NAK, 0xFF from an empty FIFO B, a register write
with a repeated START and a 2-byte read, and the same at an 8-clock
half period (4 MHz SCL at 64 MHz).  Harden run 16 (the edge-swap bit is
the only RTL change since run 15): routing 0 in 19 passes, the fastest
of any run, plus a clean re-route; KLayout DRC 0, LVS clean, antenna 0,
80 power ports legal; timing and area in the memory notes and the run's
metrics.

## 4r. Multi-bit comm shift, PIO style (2026-09-16)

CFG0[2] (a spare, packed as zero by every chroma so far) turns the comm
shifter into a 1- to 4-bit-wide one: each OUT_SHIFT moves {OUT_K_SEL1,
OUT_K_SEL0} + 1 bits, and since those two outputs are only read during
OUT_COMM_LOAD (the K select, or the table's index mode) they are free in
a shifting state.  Inputs come from the PRISM inputs shift_in_sel ..
shift_in_sel + 3 (bit 0 keeps the single-bit source, so the recoverer's
bit or cond_out[0] can still be it); MSB first the group enters below
the byte with the higher pin as the higher bit, LSB first it enters at
the top.  The shift count advances by the width, so shift_term still
marks the byte boundary for widths of 1, 2 and 4, and a load that
"counts one" (comm_load_one) counts the width instead, so a popped byte
counts as its first group.  For outputs a second register, COMM_PINS at
+0x50, names a 4-bit window of comm ([2:0] = its base, comm[base+3:base])
and a lane of that window for every uo_out pin (2 bits per pin), and
while CFG0[2] is set a pin whose pinmux code is 6 (the shifter bit) shows
that lane instead of the serial one (the window replaced seven 8:1 muxes
of any comm bit on 2026-09-17, section 4x.1): two lanes on comm[7:6] play a byte
as four pairs, four lanes on comm[7:4] as two nibbles, or from the low
end with LSB first.  The sampler's shift action is width-aware too, so
an external clock can sample four pins at once.  Not covered: the wide
(count1) shifter and the bit-serial CRC, which sees one bit per shift.

Cost: a 4-way mux on the comm shift path, a 3-bit adder on the shift
count, a 21-bit latch register and an 8:1 mux per output pin.

`chromas/chroma_pio.v` uses it both ways, and both start on a trigger:
the edge of ui_in[0] (channel 0, a SPI chip select for instance) in the
direction host_in[0] names, rising for 0, falling for 1, detected by
the in_prev[0] edge capture in one 3-input tree, `(trig ^ in_prev0) &
(trig ^ host0)`, with the other tree re-capturing on the opposite edge;
no RTL was needed for it.  host_in[1] picks the mode.  As a 4-channel
logic analyser the sampler shifts ui_in[3:0] on each edge of ui_in[4]
with the state holding {out20, out18} = 3, and after two edges (COMPARE
= 2) the FSM pushes the byte into FIFO A: samples are packed two per
byte, first sample high (MSB first) or low (LSB first); the capture
runs from the trigger until FIFO A is full (2 KB with the SRAM FIFO),
then interrupts and re-arms.  As a 2-lane waveform generator it pops
FIFO B from the trigger, shows comm[7] on uo_out[1] and comm[6] on
uo_out[2] through COMM_PINS, and shifts two bits per count1 period;
comm_load_one makes the pop count as the first pair so shift_term marks
the last, the next pop follows with no idle pair, and an empty FIFO B
interrupts and re-arms.  Five states.  `test_pio` checks that nothing
is captured or played before the trigger, both packings, a 32-sample
capture to full, all sixteen pairs of four bytes with their periods,
both edge directions, and the interrupts.  SDK: `PRISM_CTRL_MSHIFT`,
`PRISM_COMM_PIN(uo, bit)`, `prism_set_comm_pins()`.

Harden run 17: the feature is the heaviest routing addition since the
tracer - global-route wirelength +7% over run 16, Metal3 usage 84.9%
against 80.3% with 72% more overflow, since every comm bit now fans out
to all seven output-pin muxes in both shards - and detailed routing took
48 passes to reach zero (5 violations stalled from pass 33 to 45), then
a clean re-route.  KLayout DRC 0, LVS clean, antenna 0, typical setup
+0.75 ns / hold +0.28 ns, fast hold +0.10 ns, 80 power ports legal,
std-cell area 436.6k um2 (+9k, 1005 cells).  If the routing margin is
ever needed back, the lane mux is the place to trim: a 4-lane window
(comm[7:4] or [3:0], one bit) with a 2-bit lane pick per pin would cut
the comm fan-out from 7 x 8 to 4 x 2 + 7 x 4 mux inputs.

## 4s. SPI master chroma, single or quad lane (2026-09-17)

`chromas/chroma_spi_master.v`: a mode-0 SPI controller on the multi-bit
shift for a board with external tri-state buffers on the four IO lanes.
Pins: SCLK on uo_out[1] (pin_out[0]), CS_N on uo_out[2] (cond_out[0],
idle high), OE on uo_out[3] (pin_out[1]: 1 = the buffers drive IO0..IO3
from the comm lanes on uo_out[7:4] through COMM_PINS), and the lane
levels back on ui_in[4:1] (IO1 is MISO in single mode).  The width is a
per-state constant on {OUT_K_SEL1, OUT_K_SEL0}, so the chroma has one
pair of clock states per width for sending and one for reading, and
host_in[1] picks single (0) or quad (1) for every byte, so a flash-style
frame - single-lane command, quad address and data - is one CS frame
with the host switching the width between bytes.  Single mode is full
duplex (every byte sent brings one back into FIFO A), quad is half
duplex (only the read phase is kept).

Host protocol: FIFO B (shard 1's window, TX) holds the bytes to send,
COMPARE the number of bytes to read once FIFO B drains (the byte sent
meanwhile is K0 in single mode, 0xFF for a flash, and K3 in quad mode
where the lanes are released; count2 counts them), host_in[0] asserts
CS and runs the frame and clearing it ends the frame with a CS hold and
the host interrupt.  Per width the host also sets CFG0 shift_in_sel (2
= MISO on ui_in[2] for single, 1 = IO0..IO3 on ui_in[4:1] for quad) and
COMM_PINS (single: uo_out[4] <- comm[7]; quad: uo_out[4+k] <- comm[4+k]).
PRELOAD is half the SCLK period minus one, 0 giving 32 MHz at 64 MHz.
Two ordering rules follow from the FSM acting the moment it can: set the
width before pushing a byte (a byte goes out as soon as it lands in FIFO
B), and set COMPARE after the pushes (or before asserting the frame),
since with FIFO B empty a non-zero COMPARE starts the read phase at once.

The byte boundary comes from comm_load_one: a pop or K load counts the
first bit or nibble, so shift_term marks the last unit of a byte in
both widths and the shift that completes it is taken on the transition
into BYTE_END, where comm holds the byte received.  Sixteen states
(IDLE, START, NEXT_A/B, NEXT2, RX_D, TX_LOW/HIGH x 2 widths, RX_LOW/HIGH
x 2 widths, BYTE_END, END), every wait state entered by an explicit
jump.  The K-load overlap of section 4r shows up here on purpose: the
quad dummy byte is K3 because its K index is also the width.

Test: `test_spi_master` with the `QspiSlave` model in `models.py`
(resolves the four IO levels every clock from OE and its own drive;
single mode drives MISO on every falling edge, quad mode drives all
four lanes on read-phase falling edges only, i.e. edges where OE was
already low): a 4-byte full-duplex single frame (32 SCLKs), a command
plus three 0xFF-dummy reads, a quad frame of two bytes out and three
in (10 SCLKs), and a mixed frame of a single-lane command followed by a
quad address and read.

## 4t. 1-Wire master chroma (2026-09-17)

`chromas/chroma_onewire.v`: a Dallas / Maxim 1-Wire controller through
one external open-drain buffer: cond_out[0] on uo_out[1] pulls DQ low
(1 = low) and the line level comes back on ui_in[0], the shifter input.
Bits go LSB first (SHIFT_DIR = 1).  1-Wire needs five different
durations at standard speed and the chroma gets them from two timers:
count1 is one unit u of 5.5 us (PRELOAD 351 at 64 MHz) and count2 counts
units against COMPARE = 12, so 12u = 66 us is the write-0 low, the slot
length and the presence sample point, single units come from state
sequencing (write-1 low 1u, read low 1u then the DQ sample by the shift
at 2u = 11 us), and timer 2 makes the 480 us reset: PRELOAD2 = 480 us
with restart on entry into RESET_LOW (T2_RELOAD | T2_STATE(1), not
one-shot), so its first tick ends the reset low and its second tick,
480 us after the release, ends the presence window with the host
interrupt.  Presence is a data-dependent cond_out[1] (1 when DQ is low)
stored by OUT_LATCH at the 66 us sample, so the host reads it in
FLAGS[7] (latched_in[1]) after the interrupt.

Host protocol: host_in[0] = 1 opens a session (reset, presence,
interrupt), then bytes pushed into FIFO B (shard 1's window, TX) are
written as they arrive; while host_in[1] is set and FIFO B is empty,
bytes are read into FIFO A (own, RX) until host_in[1] drops, so the host
writes the command, sets host_in[1], polls FIFO A's count and clears
host_in[1] when it has what it wants (a slot or two more may be read;
they return 0xFF from an idle device); host_in[0] = 0 ends the session.
CONST K0 = 0 seeds comm for a read byte (comm_load_k with comm_load_one,
so the K load counts the first bit and shift_term marks bit 7 before
its sample, the transition that takes the byte into RD_LAST and then
FIFO A).  For writes the byte boundary is the same shift_term checked
after the slot in BIT_END.  Sixteen states: IDLE, RESET_LOW, PRES_WAIT,
PRES_END, the LOOP_A / LOOP_B ping-pong (A: pop -> write, host_in[1] ->
read, INC to B; B: !host_in[0] -> IDLE, no-match back to A), BIT_DISP,
W1_LOW, W0_LOW, W_REC, W_REST, BIT_END, RD_LOW, RD_REL, RD_REST,
RD_LAST.  No RTL change.

Test: `test_onewire` with the `OneWireSlave` model in `models.py`
(a DS18B20-like device: a master low of 40+ units is a reset answered
with a presence pulse, every other master falling edge starts a slot
that is a write slot sampled 5 units in, or a read slot where the
device holds 0 bits low for 4 units while it has reply bits queued by a
received command byte found in its `responses` table).  Phases at 8
clocks per unit: reset + presence flag, four bytes written, READ ROM
(0x33) followed by the 8-byte ROM read into FIFO A, and a session with
the device absent (presence flag 0).

## 4u. Registered debug readback (2026-09-17)

Harden run 18 (the double-edge sampling RTL) routed and passed DRC and
LVS but failed the setup checker by 21 ps at the typical corner on one
path: shard 0's comm[7] through three fanout buffers with 0.9 ns slews,
the comm == K3 comparator, the input slot mux, a 17-load select and the
register readback mux tree into TinyQV's read-data flop, 14.63 ns.  Run
17's worst path (+0.75 ns) was the same family, the state register into
the readback tree.  The debugger's live words are the only register reads
with deep logic in front of them: REG_IN_DATA (the slot muxes and
comparators), REG_OUT_DATA and REG_STEW0 (the STEW read), REG_STATUS
(next_si, the jump logic) and REG_DECISION (the LUT inputs and results).

REG_IN_DATA, REG_OUT_DATA, REG_STATUS and REG_DECISION are now
registered copies in `prism.v`, one clock old, which the host cannot
tell: a CPU read takes several clocks, and while halted nothing moves.
95 flops.  The path family is gone rather than re-rolled by the next
placement, and the fanout tree on comm[7], which the resizer built with
17 loads per buffer against the max-fanout constraint of 8, is no longer
on a critical path.

Run 19 registered the STEW word too (128 more flops) and stalled in
detailed routing at about 430 violations from iteration 23 to 55, with
the shorts at the west ends of the two middle right CFGMEM macros' pin
rows.  The cause was placement: 112 of the 223 new flops landed in the
region just west of the right macro column, through which every net to
those macros' pins passes, and its utilisation went from 41% in runs 17
and 18 to 48%.  The STEW register, 51 of those flops and not the path
that failed, was dropped again for run 20; its read path had 0.75 ns of
margin in run 17.

**Reverted (2026-09-17).**  The registered readback never produced a
converging placement on the Mac (runs 19-21) and the register-off draw of
2026-09-16 was the best seed-55 sample, so prism.v is back to the
combinational readback of run 18.  The one-clock-old note in regs.py went
with it.

## 4v. Watching and stopping a detailed route (2026-09-17)

Run 19 sat between 430 and 480 violations from iteration 23 to the
iteration limit, three minutes an iteration, with nothing to read until
the router gave up: TritonRoute only writes its DRC report at the end.
The flow now asks for one every four iterations (`DRT_SAVE_DRC_REPORT_ITERS`
in `src/config.json`, OpenROAD's `-drc_report_iter_step`), and
`tools/drt_status.py <run>` (or `make drt-status`) prints the violation
count per iteration from the step log, the counts by layer and type from
the newest report, the densest 30 um bins of the tile with their layers,
and the nets that appear most, which is what decides whether the cluster
is a pin-access pocket, a channel, or a diode crowd.  `--stop` (`make
harden-stop`) then kills that step's openroad process, so a run that is
not going to make it ends now with the report on disk instead of two
hours later.  The tool also reads a finished run's final report.

## 4w. Placement seed sweep (2026-09-17)

Runs 17 to 20 carried nearly the same netlist and their global-routing
Metal3 usage ranged from 77% to 89%, with the routing tail going from 38
iterations to a stall.  The placer is deterministic but chaotic: a few
hundred cells of change tip it into a different local minimum.  Rather
than suffer that, exploit it.  `make seed-sweep SEEDS="53 54 56 57"`
runs the flow once per target density only up to global routing (about
40 minutes each, `tools/seed_sweep.py`), `make seed-report` ranks every
`runs/seed_*` (and `runs/wokwi`) by the step-40 Metal3 overflow, and
`make seed-finish SEED=54` resumes the winner from CheckAntennas and
renames it to `runs/wokwi`.  The sweep stops early: the first seed that
passes is finished at once and the remaining seeds are skipped; if none
qualifies the best one is finished at the end.

Global-routing usage turned out not to be the gate.  Runs 20 and 21
(seed 55, 77% and 82% Metal3) both stalled in the same 30 um bin east of
the left CFGMEM column, at 633 and 984 violations there by iteration 4,
while a four-iteration replay of run 17's routing showed the same bin as
its hottest too, at 230, and run 17 converged.  So each seed now also
routes `DRT_ITERS` (4) iterations with a report every two, its score is
the hottest 30 um bin of that report, and it passes when that bin is at
or under `ACCEPT_BIN` (300) and Metal3 usage at or under `ACCEPT` (85%,
run 17's level).  Seeds run `PARALLEL` (2) at a time with the router
threads shared, about forty minutes a pair, and the winner resumes from
the routing step at the full iteration count.  Step 40 is the comparable number: the
second global-routing pass in the log is the re-route after diode
insertion.  At step 40 the runs so far read 84.9% / 9,235 (17), 88.1% /
12,402 (18), 84.5% / 9,298 (19) and 77.0% / 5,984 (20).

## 4x. Heuristic antenna diodes off (2026-09-17)

Run 20 had the best global routing of the series (Metal3 77%) and still
stalled in detailed routing, in one 90 x 90 um pocket at the east end of
the left CFGMEM column's pin rows: 477 cells at 55% utilisation where
runs 17 and 19 had 36-38%, and 198 of them antenna diodes on the loads
of the fanout trees and WROW lines there.  The heuristic inserter
(`RUN_HEURISTIC_DIODE_INSERTION`, 200 um threshold) was putting about
12,500 diodes in the tile, a third of all cells and 15% of the
standard-cell area, while the rule-based repair that follows it found
only five or six real violations and run 17's final antenna check
passed.  The heuristic step is now off; `RUN_ANTENNA_REPAIR` (OpenROAD's
repair in the global-routing loop) and the detailed router's antenna
passes stay.  The final antenna check is the guard: if it reports
violations the rule-based repair alone is not enough and the threshold
comes back at a higher value.

### 4x.1 The comm window mux, and diodes on the SRAM pins (2026-09-17)

The stuck routing pocket of runs 20 and 21 was fan-out: every comm bit
drove about 22 gates, seven of them the COMM_PINS lane muxes, one 8:1
per uo_out pin, and their fanout-buffer trees exhausted the Metal2 pin
access in one corner.  COMM_PINS is now a 4-bit window plus a lane per
pin: [2:0] the window base (comm[base+3:base], base 0-4), [2k+5:2k+4]
the lane for uo_out[k+1].  Four 5:1 window muxes are shared by the seven
pins, each of which picks one of the four lanes, so a comm bit feeds at
most four muxes instead of seven.  Every use so far fits a window: the
quad lanes are comm[7:4], the single MOSI comm[7] is window 4 lane 3,
the PIO pairs are comm[7:6], LSB-first lanes are window 0.  SDK:
PRISM_COMM_BASE(b) | PRISM_COMM_LANE(uo, lane); test helper
COMM_PINS((uo, bit), ...) derives the window from the bits and asserts
they fit.

Two flow changes went in with it.  Every standard cell is now padded by
one site per side in detailed placement (the exclusion list keeps only
the macros), which is the pin-access remedy the heuristic diodes had
been getting alone.  And because the IHP SRAM LEF carries no antenna
data, so the rule-based check cannot see its input nets, a project step
(`Project.DiodesOnSramPins`, before the first global routing) puts one diode on
every SRAM signal input pin, 156 per macro, and legalises them with a
detailed-placement pass.  It runs just before the first global routing
(after the post-CTS timing repair), so that one routing pass covers the
diodes and, unlike the port-diode step, it needs no global-routing pass
of its own; the antenna repair later re-routes only the nets it touches.

## 4y. Running the Tiny Tapeout precheck locally (2026-09-17)

Nothing in the harden had ever run the precheck; the GDS action would
have been its first look at the tile.  `make precheck RUN_DIR=runs/<run>`
runs it on a finished run's GDS the way the action does: layers, pins
against the 8x4 template, boundary, power pins, the KLayout DRC and its
zero-area and pin-label checks.  Two details of the tool: it reads
info.yaml from the GDS's directory (the target copies it there) and it
resolves its scripts and the template relative to `tt/precheck`, so it
must run from that directory, otherwise the pin, zero-area and pin-label
checks fail on missing files rather than on the layout.

The first real finding was the layer check: the tile carries DigiBnd
(16/0) and SRAM.drawing (25/0) from the IHP SRAM GDS, and our fork of
tt-support-tools (branch cmos-8x4) did not whitelist them.  Upstream main
whitelists them by name, but only in the sg13g2 list, and the cmos5l lyp
has no names for those layers, so our fork now lists them numerically,
which the check accepts.  The same two tuples are what the cmos5l branch
upstream needs.

## 4z. Macro metal, pin moves, and where to harden (2026-09-17)

Three questions came up while the placement lottery kept stalling at the
CFGMEM gap mouths; the measured answers are recorded here.

**Can the tile route on Metal1 inside the macros?**  No, and not because of
the macro: the PDK's LibreLane config sets RT_MIN_LAYER to Metal2, so neither
the tile nor the macro's own build ever lays signal wire on Metal1 (the
macro's routed DEF has 0 um of Metal1 signal wire; Metal1 is cell-internal
shapes and pins).  What the abstract LEF exposes is a separate matter:
Magic's abstract writes one bounding-box obstruction per layer, and
DFFRAM.WriteAbstractLEF rewrites only the layers listed in
LEF_ROUTE_THROUGH_LAYERS (Metal3 until now) to the drawn geometry.  So the
LEF said "all Metal2 taken" while the macro's own router uses 25% of its
Metal2 tracks (14.8 of 60 mm) and 25% of Metal3 (16.8 of 68.6 mm).

**Re-pinned macros.**  The eight Do0 pins nearest the tile-facing side face
(and EN0/A0/BYP on the LEFT variant) moved from the south face to that side
face, next to WE0/WROW (DFFRAM.librelane models/*/pin_order.cfg).  Both
macros rebuild clean.  Two draws of seed 55 with the same config:

| re-pinned macros, seed 55 | passes 0..4 | pass-4 violations | hottest 30 um bin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mac (run exp_pins) | 48632 30873 28067 15300 11562 | 11562 | 613 |
| bowser (run exp_pins) | 39205 23321 21040 7548 4376 | 4376 | 341 |
| reference run 20, old macros, Mac | 42219 24786 22513 8814 5682 | 5682 | 668 |

Opposite verdicts from one config: the spread between machines (below) is
the lottery, not the pins.  Not adopted; the products are uncommitted.

**Readback registers off** (run exp_noreg, Mac, seed 55, old macros,
PRISM_NO_REG_READBACK): 39170 21336 18993 5390 3751, hottest bin 541, the
best Mac draw of seed 55 and the hot spot moved to the right mouth.  One
sample; suggestive that the registers of 4u cost more than they gave.

**Metal2 route-through** (run exp_m2, bowser): tech.yml of the cmos5l
platform in DFFRAM.librelane now lists [Metal2, Metal3]; the rebuilt macros
carry about 10,900 Metal2 obstruction rectangles covering 17-18% of the
macro, DRC and LVS clean.  Global routing on bowser: Metal2 76.8% and Metal3
81.6% against 75.7% / 80.5% for the Metal3-only LEF of the same draw.
Detailed routing on bowser, same draw as the bowser exp_pins row above:
passes 39092 22103 20302 5858 3625, hottest bin 350 (x 1320-1350, y 480-510)
against 4376 / 341 with the Metal3-only LEF.  17% fewer violations at pass 4,
the same hot bin, and the violations still sit in the two mouths (x 800-900
and 1300-1400), not inside the macros.  The Metal2 LEF perturbs the placement
(25794 vs 25759 cells after the post-CTS repair), so part of the difference
is draw noise; the sign is favourable and the change costs nothing (macros
DRC and LVS clean), but one sample does not settle it.  Products staged in
the session scratchpad and in bowser's ihp-um-janestreet-prism_m2 copy only;
the design repo's macros/ still holds the re-pinned Metal3-only build.

**First converged tile with the re-pinned macros (bowser, 2026-09-16 night).**
The bowser exp_pins draw (seed 55, four-pass score 4376 / 341) was resumed
with `--from OpenROAD.DetailedRouting -c DRT_THREADS=32`: the router
converged to zero in under 64 passes (86 min wall; reports 2879, 1665, 546,
395, 26, 15, 10, 8, 5, 5, 5 at passes 4..52, then clean), two antenna
repair rounds re-routed clean, KLayout DRC 0, LVS 0, antenna 0, precheck
passed on bowser.  Post-route STA: setup +0.52 ns typ / +1.25 fast /
-7.07 slow (as always), hold +0.29 / +0.11 / +0.60, no hold violations.
Two lessons on the way (the first corrected on 2026-09-17): the resume did
not restart routing, it continued it.  `--from OpenROAD.DetailedRouting`
takes the newest completed state of the run, and step 46 had finished
cleanly with its 4-pass route, so step 47 started from that routed database
(its first count was 4390, the end of the 4-pass run was 4376) with the
router's pass schedule restarted.  The thread count is irrelevant to the
result: on the Mac a 24-thread and a 16-thread route of the same input gave
identical counts pass for pass.  What matters is that a restarted schedule
on an already routed design keeps improving where a single long run
freezes; LibreLane also pins the router's ordering seed (`-or_seed 42`).
The recipe is therefore: route with DRT_OPT_ITERS capped so the step ends
cleanly (a killed step leaves no database), then resume from
DetailedRouting again to continue; and bowser's PDK copy needed the sibling ihp-sg13g2
libs.tech tree because the cmos5l KLayout DRC deck includes sg13g2 rule
files by relative path.  Products copied to runs/bowser_exp_pins/final on
the Mac (gds, lef, def, nl, pnl, odb, metrics).  Not the baseline yet: the
macro re-pin is still a single-draw result.

### 4z.1 The fracture multicycle path was never applied (2026-09-17)

Every STA step logged `[WARNING STA-0361] net
'i_peripherals.i_prism.i_prism.cfg_fractured' not found` (32 times a run),
so the two `set_multicycle_path -through` lines of base.sdc were dropped in
every run so far.  Cause: cfg_fractured is a flop whose output is aliased
by `fractured = (FRACTURABLE != 0) && cfg_fractured` with FRACTURABLE = 1,
and after flattening Yosys keeps the alias one level up,
`i_peripherals.i_prism.fractured`.  Verified with the flow's Yosys on a
scratch copy: a `(* keep *)` on the register makes
`i_peripherals.i_prism.i_prism.cfg_fractured` the surviving name, so the SDC
applies unchanged; prism.v carries that attribute now (first run to use it
is the one after wokwi_m2d53).  It never cost timing: in run 18 the
tightest path through the net had +6.05 ns (typ) / +4.80 ns (fast) of slack
timed as single-cycle, far from the worst path.

### 4z.2 Data pins on Metal4 (2026-09-17)

The tile has one horizontal routing layer (Metal3; Metal1 is below
RT_MIN_LAYER) and two vertical ones, and global routing loads them Metal3
87%, Metal2 82%, Metal4 40%.  The detailed router's stuck violations are
Metal2 in the gap mouths, where every net reaching a macro's south-face pin
needs a vertical Metal2 track.  The user's idea: put the data pins on
Metal4, the under-used vertical layer, keeping clear of the power stripes
that share it.

Implementation (DFFRAM.librelane): step `DFFRAM.PinsToLayer`
(scripts/odbpy/pins_to_layer.py) runs right after GeneratePDN and moves
the bottom-edge shapes of the pins matching PINS_TO_LAYER_REGEX from
IO_PIN_V_LAYER to Metal4, shifting any that would sit within 0.3 um of a
Metal4 stripe or another pin to the nearest free track.  `dffram.py
--pins-to-metal4 '^Do0\['` (make targets cfgmem16_cmos5l_m4 /
left_cmos5l_m4) also raises the macro's RT_MAX_LAYER to Metal4 with a 90%
GRT capacity cut on that layer, and adds Metal4 to the route-through
layers so the pin-access stubs become obstructions.  Only the 24 Do0 pins
still on the south face move (Di0 stays on Metal2, so Metal4 is not
loaded by both groups); 4-5 per macro were shifted off stripes.  Both
macros build clean; the abstract has 39 Metal4 pins and ~70 tiny Metal4
obstructions (0% coverage).

A/B on bowser, same netlist (reverted readback, keep attribute, Metal2
route-through macros), seed 55, four passes, 8 threads:

| bowser, seed 55 | passes 0..4 | pass-4 violations | hottest 30 um bin |
|---|---|---|---|
| exp_ref, Do0 pins on Metal2 | 43536 27568 24261 11534 7564 | 7564 | 680 (left mouth) |
| exp_m4, Do0 pins on Metal4 | 40257 24406 22134 8012 4796 | 4796 | 362 (right mouth) |

37% fewer violations at pass 4 and the hot bin nearly halved, the largest
single-change gain measured so far; global-route usage is unchanged
(Metal4 39%).  One draw, but a same-seed one.  Next: continue exp_m4 to
convergence on bowser; if it converges, try Di0 on Metal4 as well, and
adopt the macros for the Mac runs.

### 4z.3 Run wokwi_m2d53: a clean Mac tile again (2026-09-17)

Config: readback registers reverted (run 18 RTL), re-pinned macros with
Metal2+Metal3 route-through, PL_TARGET_DENSITY_PCT 53, single seed, no
sweep, DRT_THREADS 24.  Global route Metal2 81.6% / Metal3 87.3% / Metal4
40.4%, 19828 cells after synthesis.  The first full route froze at eight
Metal2 violations in the right mouth from pass 36 on; the fix was the
continuation recipe: a second route capped at 32 passes (13 violations,
database saved by the router before its antenna rounds), then a resume from
that routed database with the pass schedule reset (state file pointing at
drt-run-0/*.odb), which reached zero on its 40th pass.  Two antenna
rounds clean, KLayout DRC 0, LVS 0, antenna 0, precheck passed.  STA:
setup +0.49 ns typ / +1.13 fast / -7.34 slow, hold +0.29 / +0.09 / +0.62,
no hold violations.  2.26 mm of signal wire at 63% utilisation.  Products
in runs/wokwi_m2d53/final.  The fractured multicycle path is still dropped
in this run (synthesised before the keep attribute of 4z.1); timing
margins above do not depend on it.

### 4z.4 The DRC deck path, and a vacuous DRC on bowser (2026-09-17)

The CI failed on `KLAYOUT_DRC_RUNSET` pointing at an absolute Mac path.  The
override exists because Tiny Tapeout's pinned ihp-sg13cmos5l snapshot ships a
trimmed KLayout deck that executes no rules, while the IHP-Open-PDK dev
branch's vendored copy is the full deck (333 rules on this tile).  Now:
src/config.json (and the col2/band variants) say
`pdk_dir::libs.tech/klayout/tech/drc/ihp-sg13cmos5l.drc`, which resolves
anywhere; local entry points (flow.py, tools/seed_sweep.py, the Makefile's
DRC_DECK) add `-c KLAYOUT_DRC_RUNSET=<dev deck>` through tools/drc_deck.py
whenever $PDK_ROOT/ihp-open-pdk-dev/... (or LIBRELANE_DRC_DECK) exists.  Ad
hoc command lines: `python -m librelane $(python3 tools/drc_deck.py) ...`.
In the CI the PDK's own (trimmed) deck is used, as Tiny Tapeout intends; the
real DRC is the local one plus the precheck.

Consequence discovered on the way: bowser's runs had been using its copy of
the snapshot deck, so the "KLayout DRC 0" of the bowser exp_pins tile was
vacuous (0 rules executed).  The dev deck (with the sg13g2 rule files it
includes by relative path) is now installed on bowser, every wrapper there
passes the override, and the exp_pins GDS is being re-checked with it.

### 4z.5 The CI's power grid: no per-macro pdngen grid (2026-09-17)

With the deck path fixed, the GitHub action failed at
OpenROAD.GeneratePDN with PDN-0233 "Failed to generate full power grid".
Cause: LibreLane's default pdn_cfg.tcl defines a pdngen grid for every
macro instance, and with this tile's single-layer Metal4 PDN those grids
end up with no shapes or vias (PDN-0232 for each of the eight CFGMEMs),
which an unpatched OpenROAD turns into PDN-0233.  The development
machines never saw it because their OpenROAD carried a patch that skips
that check (disable_check.patch in the local LibreLane flake).

Fix: src/pdn_cfg.tcl, LibreLane's file (identical in 3.0.0rc1 and 3.0.2)
without the macro grid, selected by PDN_CFG.  The macros were never
powered by that grid anyway; Project.ExtendPowerStripes does it.  Checked
locally: Metal1 rails and Metal4 stripes identical to run wokwi_m2d53,
plus 480 additional rail-to-stripe via stacks in the rows beside the
macros (x 548-1678, y 94-616) that the old macro grid's halo had kept
out; all outside the macros; power-grid connectivity check passes.
Checked in the CI's own LibreLane 3.0.0rc1 Docker image on bowser
(/scratch/kpettit/ihp, run_ci_image.sh): the old config reproduces
PDN-0233, the new one passes the step; the same image is being run on
through the custom steps to global routing to shake out any other
3.0.0rc1 difference.

Also on 2026-09-17: the GRT layer-budget experiment (exp_m4a, seed 55,
Metal4-pin macros, GRT_LAYER_ADJUSTMENTS 0,0.15,0,0,0) came out worse,
9611 violations / hottest bin 582 after pass 4 against 4796 / 362 for
the same macros without it.  The placer's routability mode uses the same
adjustments, so the placement moved too; either way, not a lever.

### 4z.6 All data pins on Metal4, and placement keep-outs at the mouths (2026-09-17)

**Di0 as well as Do0 on Metal4** (DFFRAM `make cfgmem16_cmos5l_m4
M4_PINS='^D[io]0\['`, and left): 56 bottom-edge pins per macro moved,
7-8 shifted off the power columns, all sign-off checks clean; the
abstract has 71 Metal4 pins (56 data + 15 power) and about 100 Metal4
stubs.  Run wokwi_dio53 (Mac, density 53) with them: global route Metal2
70.5% / Metal3 75.9% / Metal4 39.2%, the lowest Metal2 and Metal3 of any
run, but detailed routing 43962 30685 28812 14308 10753 9140 7578 6496
5967 5402 4030 3437 2899 and slowing; stopped.  The pass-8 report was
still two thirds Metal2 and still in the left mouth (x 840-930, y
120-300): taking the pin drops off Metal2 did not free the strip.

**Why: the mouths are full of logic.**  Cell utilisation of the placed
design: 52.8% in the hot mouth bins, 46.8% over the strip beside the left
column edge, 58.0% beside the right one, the same as the strip centre
(53.0%) and the target density, while the inside of the right column's
gap sat at 19.9%.  The placer packs the mouths to full density and every
net into the macro pin rows then has to cross those cells' Metal2 tracks.

**Keep-outs.**  Project.MouthKeepouts (odb_keepouts.py, inserted after
Odb.ManualMacroPlacement) derives, from the macro instances, one strip per
gap between consecutive macros of a column on the column's tile-facing
side: MOUTH_KEEPOUT_WIDTH (60 um) outward from the edge, the gap plus
MOUTH_KEEPOUT_MARGIN (20 um) into each macro, as a soft placement
blockage capped at MOUTH_KEEPOUT_MAX_DENSITY (0.25; 0 = hard).  Six
strips on this floorplan (x 868-928 and 1286-1346; y 71-277, 324-387,
434-640).  Effect at detailed placement: the hot mouth bins fall from
52.8% to 2.3% and the right mouth from 58.0% to 3.6%; the cells move
inward (right gap interior 19.9% -> 38.0%) and the tile still places at
density 53.  Run wokwi_ko53 (Mac, density 53, Metal4-pin macros) is the
first with them.

**Keep-out geometry sweep (bowser, same netlist, density 53, four passes).**

| keep-out | passes 0..4 | pass-4 violations | hottest bin |
|---|---|---|---|
| none (exp_m4d53) | 6788 at pass 4 | 6788 | |
| outside only, 60 um, cap 0.25 (koA) | 39030 22886 21394 6716 3555 | 3555 | 219 |
| + 45 um inward (koC) | 39311 22599 21395 8633 6004 | 6004 | 453 |
| + 90 um inward (koB) | 43034 28196 25644 10994 8092 | 8092 | 604 |
| + 90 um inward, cap 0.40 (koD) | 44922 27355 24811 9564 7191 | 7191 | 628 |

The strip outside the column edge halves the pass-4 count and gives the
lowest hot bin measured on this tile; reaching inward over the gap makes
every measure worse (the displaced logic lengthens the wires and raises
tile-wide congestion; on the Mac the 90 um variant's global route hit
Metal3 90.7% and its first detailed-routing pass had not finished after 90
minutes).  MOUTH_KEEPOUT_INWARD stays 0.  koA is being routed to
completion on bowser; the Mac reruns the outside-only configuration at
density 53 to completion (it had been stopped at pass 9 while still
descending).

### 4z.7 koA: the first single-start clean route, and two flow defects it exposed (2026-09-17)

bowser run koA (outside-only keep-outs, all data pins on Metal4, density
53) routed to zero in one uninterrupted start: 39030 22886 21394 6716
3555 ... 170 84 24 12 2 1 1 0, clean at about pass 44, 52 minutes at 24
threads, followed by three antenna-repair rounds that each re-routed to
zero.  Then two defects:

1. **DEF blockage syntax.**  The keep-outs had been created as soft
   blockages with a density cap, which OpenROAD writes to DEF as
   `PLACEMENT + SOFT + PARTIAL 0.25`; the DEF standard allows one of the
   two, and the RC-extraction step, which re-reads the DEF, failed with
   DEFPARS-6543.  Fixed in odb_keepouts.py: density cap only (`+ PARTIAL`),
   with the same placement effect (hot mouth bins 0.7% and 2.2%).  koA was
   salvaged by stripping the blockages from the routed database and DEF
   (bowser strip_blockages.py) and resuming from OpenROAD.RCX.
2. **Antenna repair rounds.**  After the three post-route repair rounds
   (DRT_ANTENNA_REPAIR_ITERS default 3) two resizer buffer nets, net2077
   and net3089, still exceed the Metal3 cumulative-area ratio (265 and 419
   against 200).  The config now asks for 6 rounds; a continuation from
   the routed state to add rounds is not possible with the Metal4-pin
   macros (DRT-1231 pin access, as before), so koA is being re-routed
   from scratch with the new setting (deterministic, so the same route
   plus more rounds).

koA's sign-off otherwise: KLayout DRC 0 with the full 333-rule deck, LVS
0, hold clean, setup +0.15 ns typ / +1.25 fast / -7.47 slow, precheck
passed.  The Mac's same-recipe run (wokwi_ko53) plateaued at 377 around
pass 40.

**koA, second pass (2026-09-18 00:19).**  Re-routed from the same placement
with the blockages stripped before routing and six antenna rounds allowed:
the route replayed exactly (zero at pass 44), five antenna rounds each
re-routed to zero, antenna 0 nets / 0 pins, KLayout DRC 0 (333 rules), LVS
0, hold clean, setup +0.15 ns typ / +1.25 fast / -7.47 slow, 2.29 mm of
signal wire at 63.3% utilisation, precheck passed.  One start, no
intervention inside the flow.  Products copied to the Mac at
runs/bowser_koA/final.

The GitHub action on the same commit (802b62f) synthesised the same
netlist as bowser (x86-64 ABC gives 20034 cells whatever the LibreLane
version) but its detailed route had not converged when the job hit the
6-hour limit: the runner has 4 cores and its LibreLane 3.0.0rc1 carries a
different OpenROAD than our 3.0.2 nix build, so it is a different router
on the same placement.  Pinning the action to a LibreLane whose OpenROAD
matches ours would let the runner replay bowser's route rather than draw
its own.

**Predicting the runner (2026-09-18).**  The published LibreLane 3.0.2 image
on x86-64 is deterministic, so what the GitHub runner will do can be run
ahead of time on bowser (Docker, /scratch/kpettit/ihp/run_ci_image.sh with
IMAGE=ghcr.io/librelane/librelane:3.0.2).  The koA recipe at density 53 in
that image is a neighbour of koA, not a replay (our nix OpenROAD has newer
flake inputs): 40889 24425 22454 7919 5128 at four passes against koA's
3555, then 2644, 1004, 669, 295, 153, 71, 45, 20, 12 and a frozen knot of
11 Metal2 shorts from pass 44 on at x 1350-1360, y 558-571, just inward of
the right column's keep-out.  Correction found while committing: the repo's config still said density
55 (every converging local run had used a -c override of 53), so the
action pinned to 3.0.2 actually drew at 55, the worst of the sweep below;
it will not close either way.  The remedy that follows from determinism: sweep
the placement density in the image on bowser (four passes each), route
the best draw to completion there, and commit that density; the runner
then replays a route already known to converge.

Sweep in the image, four passes each: 51 -> 3987, 52 -> 3721, 53 -> 5128,
54 -> 5416, 55 -> 8298.  Density 52 is committed (828b833) while its full
route is verified in the image on bowser.

**Runs are not reproducible across machines.**  Same Yosys 0.62 (same git
sha, both built with clang 21.1.2 by nix), identical 3165 flops and latches,
but ABC maps the combinational logic differently on Apple silicon and x86-64
Linux (20222 vs 20112 cells): libc qsort ordering of equal keys, last-bit
libm differences and FMA contraction change ABC's tie-breaks, and the placer
diverges from there.  Within a machine the flow is deterministic.  Compare
runs only within one machine, and finish a converging run where it started.

**Where the submission GDS is built.**  The gds workflow runs
kdp1965/tt-gds-action@ihp-cmos5l-fix on ubuntu-24.04 with
`pip install librelane==3.0.0rc1` (the action's default) and hardens with
`--dockerized`, i.e. the LibreLane 3.0.0rc1 Docker image on x86-64 Linux.
A seed that converges on the Mac says nothing about that environment.
bowser (48 cores, Docker 29, user in the docker group) can run the same
image, and nix-built x86-64 binaries are deterministic across machines, so a
sweep there in the CI image should predict CI exactly.  To do before relying
on it: one run of the current flow (substituting steps, DiodesOnSramPins,
ExtendPowerStripes) under the unpatched 3.0.0rc1 image, and a check that the
detailed router gives the same answer at the runner's 4 threads.

**bowser notes.**  Work dir /prj/kpettit/other/ihp (NFS from "peach", 7.6 TB
free; the root disk with /scratch is 98% full).  Toolchain from the same
patched LibreLane checkout via nix (the first build attempt had been killed
by a stray pkill; the full rebuild takes about 25 minutes on 48 cores).  The
PDK copy needs real files where the cmos5l tree symlinks into ihp-sg13g2
(libs.ref/sg13cmos5l_sram, libs.tech/librelane/IHP_rcx_patterns.rules).  The
merged config carries the Mac's absolute KLAYOUT_DRC_RUNSET path;
/prj/kpettit/other/ihp/run_exp.sh rewrites it and launches a seed run
(`REPO=... run_exp.sh TAG SEED DRT_ITERS THREADS`).  Global routing is
single-threaded, so the machine's value is parallel seeds, not a faster
single run (detailed routing: 18.8 min at 16 threads there vs 20.3 min at 8
threads on the Mac for a harder draw).

## 5. FIFO storage, item 9: SRAM spike result

`RM_IHPSG13_2P_64x32_c2` is reachable from the cmos5l PDK
(`libs.ref/sg13cmos5l_sram` is a symlink to the sg13g2 SRAM library) with
LEF, GDS, three lib corners, Verilog and CDL views.  Its GDS uses Metal1 to
Metal4 only (no Metal5 / TopMetal), so the layers fit the CMOS5L stack.  It
is a true dual-port (A and B ports) 64 x 32 macro of 702.83 x 74.87 um,
about 52,600 um2, 1.8 CFGMEM16 macros' worth of area each.

The problem is power.  Its VDD!, VSS! and VDDARRAY! pins are 40 vertical
Metal4 stripes each, 4.42 um wide on a 17.68 um pitch, interleaved so that
VDD and VSS alternate every 8.84 um, with VDDARRAY occupying the top part of
the VDD columns.  The Tiny Tapeout cmos5l tile has a single-layer PDN of
Metal4 stripes on a 50 um pitch (VPWR/VGND 4.1 um apart) and nothing routable
above Metal4, so the CFGMEM trick (macro stripes on the tile grid, extended
to full height) does not apply: the SRAM stripes cannot be made to coincide
with the tile pairs, and both polarities reach the macro edges so no edge
strap can pick one up.  Connecting it would need off-grid Metal4 stripes and
a scheme for the third supply, neither of which the TT chip assembly is
known to accept.

Decision: small standard-cell (flop) FIFOs per shard for now, 16 to 32
bytes, roughly 3 to 6 k um2 each.  If area is left at the end, a small SRAM
macro may go in as an experiment (see section 7), on the chance the design
is selected for manufacture.  If deeper
buffering turns out to matter (frames, not bytes), the DFFRAM.librelane flow
in this workspace can build a small register-file macro with TT-compatible
power stripes the same way the CFGMEM macros were built.

## 6. Decisions (2026-09-12)

1. Outputs are renumbered in one step: break every chroma, fix them all at
   once together with the datapath refactor.
2. `in_prev` replaces `latched_in`.  A LUT3 can only evaluate one edge
   compare, so `in_prev` simply carries the latched value of whichever
   latchable input (ui_in pin or host_in) that decision tree is decoding.
3. Cross-shard signalling: yes, a sticky semaphore in each direction, set by
   the sending shard's OUT_SEMA_SET and cleared by the receiving shard's
   OUT_SEMA_CLEAR.  Same-cycle set/clear priority is a per-shard config bit.
4. A third counter is not needed yet; output 17 stays spare.
5. Interrupt clear stays a byte write (0x03 for shard 0); it is what the
   PCM/ADPCM style chromas depend on.  Interrupts are per shard: two
   interrupt lines back to the host.
6. Host interrupt is a dedicated output (14), not the old COUNT2_CLEAR +
   COUNT2_INC coincidence, which was a 2-tile size workaround.

## 7. SRAM power hookup, second look

Passing the standard 50 um stripe pairs through the macro does not work in
general: a VPWR/VGND pair needs 6.2 um plus clearance and the gaps between
the macro's own Metal4 columns are 4.42 um, and the 17.68 um column period
against the 50 um stripe pitch lets at most 4 of the 14 crossing pairs land
one stripe on a matching column with the other in a gap (best placements at
x = 985.8 or 1003.5 um).  Flattened, the macro's Metal4 is only the vertical
power columns (no horizontal straps), so nothing else is in the way.

A hand-built comb does look feasible: let pdngen carve the tile stripes
around the macro as it does today, then in a scripted step add short Metal4
stubs on every VDD column below the macro and a Metal3 VDD bus under them
(Via3 at the stubs), a second, lower Metal3 bus for the VSS columns with
longer stubs, and the same above the macro for VDDARRAY (tied to VDD) and
VSS.  The buses cross the neighbouring tile stripes, which are strapped with
Via3 at the right polarity.  It needs about 8 to 10 um of halo above and
below, roughly 160 stubs and vias per macro, and a DRC/LVS run to prove it.
Whether the IHP SRAM is valid on CMOS5L silicon at all (same front end as
sg13g2, but no known Tiny Tapeout use) is the remaining unknown.
