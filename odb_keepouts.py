Placement keep-outs at the CFGMEM "mouths".

Every stalled route of this tile died in the same places: the strip of
standard-cell rows just outside a CFGMEM column's tile-facing edge, at the
height of the gap between the two macros of a pair.  Every net for the
macros' pins crosses that strip, and the placer fills it to the target
density as well, so its Metal2 tracks run out.  This step puts a placement
blockage on each such strip before global placement: a density cap
(DEF PARTIAL) by default so the placer thins the logic there, hard when
the cap is 0.

The geometry comes from the macro instances: the columns are found by x,
the tile-facing side is the one toward the core centre, and the strip spans
the gap between consecutive macros of a column plus a margin into each, and
can reach inward over the gap as well (--inward), where the displaced logic
otherwise piles up against the keep-out.
